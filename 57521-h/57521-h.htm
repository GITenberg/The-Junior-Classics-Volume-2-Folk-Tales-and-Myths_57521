<p><i>The character of the contents of volumes 1, 2 and
3 is so closely related that they may be said to constitute
three volumes under one general title. There
are myths of Greece and Rome in this volume as
well as in volume 3, and there are more animal
myths in volume 1, particularly of the Hindoos and
of the North American Indians.</i></p>

<p><i>What gives the volume a special character is the
large group of stories from the Sagas or Epic
Songs of the Northmen, including the story of
Brunhilda and Siegfried, and a particularly attractive
version of Lohengrin, condensed, but not rewritten,
from the story by Miss Maud.</i></p>

<p><i>These stories belong to us, in a very particular
sense, since the blood that flows in the veins of
English and American boys is largely the blood of
the fair-faced, fair-haired Northmen (or Scandinavians,
or Danes, or whatever we call them) who
invaded England in the ninth and tenth centuries.
Their strong bodies and strong wills have worked
wonders in the world and have made the world a
pleasanter place to live in. It was the Northman
blood that sent Robinson Crusoe a-wandering, and
helped Christian defeat the Giant in Doubting
Castle.</i></p>

<h2 id="THE_NORTHMENS_STORY_OF_HOW">THE NORTHMEN’S STORY OF HOW
ALL THINGS BEGAN</h2>

<p class="author">By E. M. Wilmot-Buxton</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time, before ever this world was
made, there was neither earth nor sea, nor
air, nor light, but only a great yawning gulf, full
of twilight.</p>

<p>To the north of this gulf lay the Home of Mist,
a dark and dreary land, out of which flowed a river
of water from a spring that never ran dry. As the
water in its onward course met the bitter blasts of
wind from the yawning gulf, it hardened into great
blocks of ice, which rolled far down into the abyss
with a thunderous roar and piled themselves one on
another until they formed mountains of glistening
ice.</p>

<p>South of this gulf lay the Home of Fire, a land
of burning heat, guarded by a giant with a flaming
sword, which, as he flashed it to and fro before
the entrance, sent forth showers of sparks. And
these sparks fell upon the ice-blocks and partly
melted them, so that they sent up clouds of steam;
and these again were frozen into hoar-frost, which
filled all the space that was left in the midst of the
mountains of ice.</p>

<p>Then one day, when the gulf was full to the very
top, this great mass of frosty rime, warmed by the
flames from the Home of Fire, and frozen by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cold airs from the Home of Mist, came to life and
became the Giant Ymir, with a living, moving
body and cruel heart of ice.</p>

<p>Now there was as yet no tree, nor grass, nor
anything that would serve for food, in this gloomy
abyss. But when the Giant Ymir began to grope
around for something to satisfy his hunger, he
heard a sound as of some animal chewing the cud;
and there among the ice-hills he saw a gigantic
cow, from whose udder flowed four great streams
of milk, and with this his craving was easily stilled.</p>

<p>But the cow was hungry also, and began to lick
the salt off the blocks of ice by which she was surrounded.
And presently, as she went on licking
with her strong, rough tongue, a head of hair
pushed itself through the melting ice. Still the
cow went on licking, until she had at last melted
all the icy covering and there stood fully revealed
the frame of a mighty man.</p>

<p>Ymir looked with eyes of hatred at this being,
born of snow and ice, for somehow he knew that
his heart was warm and kind, and that he and his
sons would always be the enemies of the evil race
of the Frost Giants.</p>

<p>So, indeed, it came to pass. For from the sons
of Ymir came a race of giants whose pleasure was
to work evil on the earth; and from the Sons of the
Iceman sprang the race of the gods, chief of whom
was Odin, Father of All Things that ever were
made; and Odin and his brothers began at once to
war against the wicked Frost Giants, and most of
all against the cold-hearted Ymir.</p>

<p>Now when, after a hard fight, the Giant Ymir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was slain, such a river of blood flowed forth from
his wounds that it drowned all the rest of the
Frost Giants save one, who escaped in a boat, with
only his wife on board, and sailed away to the edge
of the world. And from him sprang all the new
race of Frost Giants, who at every opportunity
issued from their land of twilight and desolation
to harm the gods in their abode of bliss.</p>

<p>When the giants had been thus driven out, All-Father
Odin set to work with his brothers to make
the earth, the sea, and the sky; and these they
fashioned out of the great body of the Giant Ymir.</p>

<p>Out of his flesh they formed Midgard, the earth,
which lay in the center of the gulf; and all round
it they planted his eyebrows to make a high fence
which should defend it from the race of giants.</p>

<p>With his bones they made the lofty hills, with
his teeth the cliffs, and his thick curly hair took root
and became trees, bushes, and the green grass.</p>

<p>With his blood they made the ocean, and his
great skull, poised aloft, became the arching sky.
Just below this they scattered his brains, and made
of them the heavy gray clouds that lie between
earth and heaven.</p>

<p>The sky itself was held in place by four strong
dwarfs, who support it on their broad shoulders
as they stand east and west and south and north.</p>

<p>The next thing was to give light to the new-made
world. So the gods caught sparks from the Home
of Fire and set them in the sky for stars; and they
took the living flame and made of it the sun and
moon, which they placed in chariots of gold, and
harnessed to them beautiful horses, with flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
manes of gold and silver. Before the horses of the
sun they placed a mighty shield to protect them
from its hot rays; but the swift moon steeds needed
no such protection from its gentle heat.</p>

<p>And now all was ready save that there was no
one to drive the horses of the sun and moon. This
task was given to Mani and Sol, the beautiful son
and daughter of a giant; and these fair charioteers
drive their fleet steeds along the paths marked out
by the gods, and not only give light to the earth
but mark out months and days for the sons of men.</p>

<p>Then All-Father Odin called forth Night, the
gloomy daughter of the cold-hearted giant folk,
and set her to drive the dark chariot drawn by the
black horse, Frosty-Mane, from whose long wavy
hair the drops of dew and hoar-frost fall upon the
earth below. After her drove her radiant son, Day,
with his white steed Shining-Mane, from whom the
bright beams of daylight shine forth to gladden
the hearts of men.</p>

<p>But the wicked giants were very angry when
they saw all these good things; and they set in the
sky two hungry wolves, that the fierce, gray
creatures might forever pursue the sun and moon,
and devour them, and so bring all things to an end.
Sometimes, indeed, or so say the men of the North,
the gray wolves almost succeed in swallowing sun
or moon; and then the earth children make such
an uproar that the fierce beasts drop their prey
in fear. And the sun and moon flee more rapidly
than before, still pursued by the hungry monsters.</p>

<p>One day, so runs the tale, as Mani, the Man in
the Moon, was hastening on his course, he gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
upon the earth and saw two beautiful little children,
a boy and a girl, carrying between them a
pail of water. They looked very tired and sleepy,
and indeed they were, for a cruel giant made them
fetch and carry water all night long, when they
should have been in bed. So Mani put out a
long, long arm and snatched up the children and
set them in the moon, pail and all; and there
you can see them on any moonlight night for
yourself.</p>

<p>But that happened a long time after the beginning
of things; for as yet there was no man or
woman or child upon the earth.</p>

<p>And now that this pleasant Midgard was made,
the gods determined to satisfy their desire for a
home where they might rest and enjoy themselves
in their hours of ease.</p>

<p>They chose a suitable place far above the earth,
on the other side of the great river which flowed
from the Home of Mist where the giants dwelt,
and here they made for their abode Asgard, wherein
they dwelt in peace and happiness, and from
whence they could look down upon the sons of men.</p>

<p>From Asgard to Midgard they built a beautiful
bridge of many colors, to which men gave the name
of Rainbow Bridge, and up and down which the
gods could pass on their journeys to and from the
earth.</p>

<p>Here in Asgard stood the mighty forge where
the gods fashioned their weapons wherewith they
fought the giants, and the tools wherewith they
built their palaces of gold and silver.</p>

<p>Meantime, no human creature lived upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
earth, and the giants dared not cross its borders
for fear of the gods. But one of them, clad in
eagle’s plumes, always sat at the north side of
Midgard, and, whenever he raised his arms and let
them fall again, an icy blast rushed forth from the
Mist Home and nipped all the pleasant things of
earth with its cruel breath. In due time the earth
brought forth thousands of tiny creatures, which
crawled about and showed signs of great intelligence.
And when the gods examined these little
people closely, they found that they were of two
kinds.</p>

<p>Some were ugly, misshapen, and cunning-faced,
with great heads, small bodies, long arms and feet.
These they called Trolls or Dwarfs or Gnomes,
and sent them to live underground, threatening to
turn them into stone should they appear in the
daytime. And this is why the trolls spend all
their time in the hidden parts of the earth, digging
for gold and silver and precious stones, and hiding
their spoil away in secret holes and corners. Sometimes
they blow their tiny fires and set to work to
make all kinds of wonderful things from this buried
treasure; and that is what they are doing when, if
one listens very hard on the mountains and hills of
the Northland, a sound of tap-tap-tapping is heard
far underneath the ground.</p>

<p>The other small earth creatures were very fair
and light and slender, kindly of heart and full of
good will. These the gods called Fairies or Elves,
and gave to them a charming place called Elfland
in which to dwell. Elfland lies between Asgard
and Midgard, and since all fairies have wings they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
can easily flit down to the earth to play with the
butterflies, teach the young birds to sing, water the
flowers, or dance in the moonlight round a fairy
ring.</p>

<p>Last of all, the gods made a man and woman to
dwell in fair Midgard; and this is the manner of
their creation.</p>

<p>All-Father Odin was walking with his brothers
in Midgard where, by the seashore, they found
growing two trees, an ash and an elm. Odin took
these trees and breathed on them, whereupon a wonderful
transformation took place. Where the trees
had stood, there were a living man and woman, but
they were stupid, pale, and speechless, until Hœnir,
the god of Light, touched their foreheads and gave
them sense and wisdom; and Loki, the Fire-god,
smoothed their faces, giving them bright color and
warm blood, and the power to speak and see and
hear.</p>

<p>It only remained that they should be named,
and they were called Ask and Embla, the names
of the trees from which they had been formed.
From these two people sprang all the race of men
which lives upon this earth.</p>

<p>And now All-Father Odin completed his work
by planting the Tree of Life.</p>

<p>This immense tree had its roots in Asgard and
Midgard and the Mist Land; and it grew to such
a marvellous height that the highest bough, the
Bough of Peace, hung over the Hall of Odin on the
heights of Asgard; and the other branches overshadowed
both Midgard and the Mist Land. On
the top of the Peace Bough was perched a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
eagle, and ever a falcon sat between his eyes, and
kept watch on all that happened in the world below,
that he might tell to Odin what he saw.</p>

<p>Heidrun, the goat of Odin, who supplied the
heavenly mead, browsed on the leaves of this wonderful
tree, and from them fed also the four mighty
stags from whose horns honey-dew dropped on to
the earth beneath and supplied water for all the
rivers of Midgard.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Tree of Life were ever green
and fair, despite the dragon which, aided by countless
serpents, gnawed perpetually at its roots, in
order that they might kill the Tree of Life and thus
bring about the destruction of the gods.</p>

<p>Up and down the branches of the tree scampered
the squirrel, Ratatosk, a malicious little
creature, whose one amusement it was to make mischief
by repeating to the eagle the rude remarks of
the dragon, and to the dragon those of the eagle,
in the hope that one day he might see them in actual
conflict.</p>

<p>Near the roots of the Tree of Life is a sacred
well of sweet water from which the three Weird
Sisters, who know all that shall come to pass,
sprinkle the tree and keep it fresh and green. And
the water, as it trickles down from the leaves, falls
as drops of honey on the earth, and the bees take it
for their food.</p>

<p>Close to this sacred well is the Council Hall of
the gods, to which every morning they rode, over
the Rainbow Bridge, to hold converse together.</p>

<p>And this is the end of the tale of How All Things
began.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_THE_QUEEN_OF_THE_SKY">HOW THE QUEEN OF THE SKY
GAVE GIFTS TO MEN</h2>

<p class="author">By E. M. Wilmot-Buxton</p>

<p class="dropcap">By the side of All-Father Odin, upon his high
seat in Asgard, sat Frigga, his wife, the Queen
of the Asas. Sometimes she would be dressed in
snow-white garments, bound at the waist by a
golden girdle, from which hung a great bunch of
golden keys. And the earth-dwellers, gazing into
the sky, would admire the great white clouds as
they floated across the blue, not perceiving that
these clouds were really the folds of Frigga’s flowing
white robe, as it waved in the wind.</p>

<p>At other times she would wear dark gray or
purple garments; and then the earth-dwellers made
haste into their houses, for they said, “the sky is
lowering to-day, and a storm is nigh at hand.”</p>

<p>Frigga had a palace of her own called Fensalir,
or the Hall of Mists, where she spent much of her
time at her wheel, spinning golden thread, or weaving
web after web of many-colored clouds. All
night long she sat at this golden wheel, and if you
look at the sky on a starry night you may chance
to see it set up where the men of the South show
a constellation called the Girdle of Orion.</p>

<p>Husbands and wives who had dwelt lovingly together
upon earth were invited by Frigga to her
hall when they died, so they might be forever
united within its hospitable walls.</p>

<p>Frigga was especially interested in all good
housewives, and she herself set them an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
example in Fensalir. When the snowflakes fell, the
earth-dwellers knew it was Frigga shaking her
great feather bed, and when it rained they said it
was her washing day. It was she who first gave to
them the gift of flax that the women upon earth
might spin, and weave, and bleach their linen as
white as the clouds of her own white robe.</p>

<p>And this is how it came about.</p>

<p>There once was a shepherd who lived among the
mountains with his wife and children; and so
very poor was he that he often found it hard to
give his family enough to satisfy their hunger. But
he did not grumble; he only worked the harder;
and his wife, though she had scarcely any furniture,
and never a chance of a new dress, kept the
house so clean, and the old clothes so well mended,
that, all unknown to herself, she rose high in the
favor of the all-seeing Frigga.</p>

<p>Now one day, when the shepherd had driven his
few poor sheep up the mountain to pasture, a fine
reindeer sprang from the rocks above him and
began to leap upward along the steep slope. The
shepherd snatched up his crossbow and pursued the
animal, thinking to himself: “Now we shall have
a better meal than we have had for many a long
day.”</p>

<p>Up and up leaped the reindeer, always just out
of reach, and at length disappeared behind a great
boulder just as the shepherd, breathless and weary,
reached the spot. No sign of the reindeer was to
be seen, but, on looking round, the shepherd saw
that he was among the snowy heights of the mountains,
and almost at the top of a great glacier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently, as he pursued his vain search for the
animal, he saw to his amazement an open door,
leading apparently into the heart of the glacier.
He was a fearless man, and so, without hesitation,
he passed boldly through the doorway and found
himself standing in a marvellous cavern, lit up by
blazing torches which gleamed upon rich jewels
hanging from the roof and walls. And in the midst
stood a woman, most fair to behold, clad in snow-white
robes and surrounded by a group of lovely
maidens.</p>

<p>The shepherd’s boldness gave way at this awesome
sight, and he sank to his knees before the Asa,
Frigga, for she it was. But Frigga bade him be of
good cheer, and said: “Choose now whatsoever you
will to carry away with you as a remembrance of
this place.”</p>

<p>The shepherd’s eyes wandered over the glittering
jewels on the walls and roof, but they came back to
a little bunch of blue flowers which Frigga held in
her hand. They alone looked homelike to him; the
rest were hard and cold; so he asked timidly that
he might be given the little nosegay.</p>

<p>Then Frigga smiled kindly upon him.</p>

<p>“Most wise has been your choice,” said she.
“Take with the flowers this measure of seed and
sow it in your field, and you shall grow flowers of
your own. They shall bring prosperity to you and
yours.”</p>

<p>So the shepherd took the flowers and the seed,
and scarcely had he done so when a mighty peal of
thunder, followed by the shock of an earthquake,
rent the cavern, and when he had collected his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
senses he found himself once more upon the mountain
side.</p>

<p>When he reached home and had told his tale, his
wife scolded him roundly for not bringing home a
jewel which would have made them rich forever.
But when she would have thrown the flowers away
he prevented her. Next day he sowed the seed
in his field, and was surprised to find how far it
went.</p>

<p>Very soon after this the field was thick with tiny
green shoots; and though his wife reproached him
for wasting good ground upon useless flowers, he
watched and waited in hope until the field was blue
with the starry flax blooms.</p>

<p>Then one night, when the flowers had withered
and the seed was ripe, Frigga, in the disguise of an
old woman, visited the lowly hut and showed the
shepherd and his astonished wife how to use the
flax stalks; how to spin them into thread, and how
to weave the thread into linen.</p>

<p>It was not long before all the dwellers in that
part of the earth had heard of the wonderful material,
and were hurrying to the shepherd’s hut to
buy bleached linen or the seed from which it was
obtained. And so the shepherd and his family were
soon among the richest people in the land; and the
promise of Frigga was amply fulfilled.</p>

<h2 id="THE_DWARFS_AND_THE_FAIRIES">THE DWARFS AND THE FAIRIES</h2>

<p class="author">By A. and E. Keary</p>

<p class="dropcap">“The earth is very beautiful,” said Odin,
from the top of his throne, “very beautiful
in every part, even to the shores of the dark North
Sea; but, alas! the men of the earth are puny and
fearful. At this moment I see a three-headed
giant striding out of Jötunheim. He throws a
shepherd-boy into the sea, and puts the whole of the
flock into his pocket. Now he takes them out again
one by one, and cracks their bones as if they were
hazel-nuts, whilst, all the time, men look on, and
do nothing.”</p>

<p>“Father,” cried Thor in a rage, “last night I
forged for myself a belt, a glove, and a hammer,
with which three things I will go forth alone to
Jötunheim.”</p>

<p>Thor went, and Odin looked again.</p>

<p>“The men of the earth are idle and stupid,” said
Odin. “There are dwarfs and elves, who live
amongst them, and play tricks which they cannot
understand, and do not know how to prevent. At
this moment I see a husbandman sowing grains of
wheat in the furrows, while a dwarf runs after
him, and changes them into stones. Again, I see
two hideous little beings, who are holding under
water the head of one, the wisest of men, until he
dies; they mix his blood with honey; they have put
it into three stone jars, and hidden it away.”</p>

<p>Then Odin was very angry with the dwarfs, for
he saw that they were bent on mischief; so he called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to him Hermod, his Flying Word, and despatched
him with a message to the dwarfs and light elves, to
say that Odin sent his compliments, and would be
glad to speak with them, in his palace of Gladsheim,
upon a matter of some importance.</p>

<p>When they received Hermod’s summons the
dwarfs and light elves were very much surprised,
not quite knowing whether to feel honored or afraid.
However, they put on their pertest manners, and
went clustering after Hermod like a swarm of ladybirds.</p>

<p>When they were arrived in the great city they
found Odin descended from his throne, and sitting
with the rest of the Æsir in the Judgment Hall of
Gladsheim. Hermod flew in, saluted his master,
and pointed to the dwarfs and elves hanging like
a cloud in the doorway to show that he had fulfilled
his mission. Then Odin beckoned the little people
to come forward. Cowering and whispering they
peeped over one another’s shoulders; now running
on a little way into the hall, now back again, half
curious, half afraid; and it was not until Odin had
beckoned three times that they finally reached his
footstool.</p>

<p>Then Odin spoke to them in calm, low, serious
tones about the wickedness of their mischievous
propensities. Some, the very worst of them,
only laughed in a forward, hardened manner;
but a great many looked up surprised and a little
pleased at the novelty of serious words; while
the light elves all wept, for they were tender-hearted
little things. At length Odin spoke to the
two dwarfs by name whom he had seen drowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the wise man. “Whose blood was it,” he asked,
“that you mixed with honey and put into jars?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the dwarfs, jumping up into the air,
and clapping their hands, “that was Kvasir’s blood.
Don’t you know who Kvasir was? He sprang up
out of the peace made between the Vanir and yourselves,
and has been wandering about these seven
years or more; so wise he was that men thought he
must be a god. Well, just now we found him lying
in a meadow drowned in his own wisdom; so we
mixed his blood with honey, and put it into three
great jars to keep. Was not that well done, Odin?”</p>

<p>“Well done!” answered Odin. “Well done!
You cruel, cowardly, lying dwarfs! I myself saw
you kill him. For shame! for shame!” and then
Odin proceeded to pass sentence upon them all.
Those who had been the most wicked, he said, were
to live, henceforth, a long way underground, and
were to spend their time in throwing fuel upon the
great earth’s central fire; while those who had only
been mischievous were to work in the gold and diamond
mines, fashioning precious stones and metals.
They might all come up at night, Odin said; but
must vanish at the dawn. Then he waved his hand,
and the dwarfs turned round, shrilly chattering,
scampered down the palace-steps, out of the city,
over the green fields, to their unknown, deep-buried
earth-homes. But the light elves still lingered, with
upturned, tearful, smiling faces, like sunshiny
morning dew.</p>

<p>“And you,” said Odin, looking them through
and through with his serious eyes, “and you——”</p>

<p>“Oh! indeed, Odin,” interrupted they, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
all together in quick, uncertain tones; “Oh! indeed,
Odin, we are not so very wicked. We have never
done anybody any harm.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever done anybody any good?” asked
Odin.</p>

<p>“Oh! no, indeed,” answered the light elves, “we
have never done anything at all.”</p>

<p>“You may go, then,” said Odin, “to live among
the flowers, and play with the wild bees and summer
insects. You must, however, find something
to do, or you will get to be mischievous like the
dwarfs.”</p>

<p>“If only we had any one to teach us,” said
the light elves, “for we are such foolish little
people.”</p>

<p>Odin looked round inquiringly upon the Æsir;
but among them there was no teacher found for the
silly little elves. Then he turned to Niörd, who
nodded his head good-naturedly, and said, “Yes,
yes, I will see about it;” and then he strode out of
the Judgment Hall, right away through the city
gates, and sat down upon the mountain’s edge.</p>

<p>After awhile he began to whistle in a most alarming
manner, louder and louder, in strong wild gusts,
now advancing, now retreating; then he dropped
his voice a little, lower and lower, until it became
a bird-like whistle—low, soft, enticing music, like a
spirit’s call; and far away from the south a little
fluttering answer came, sweet as the invitation
itself, nearer and nearer until the two sounds
dropped into one another. Then through the clear
sky two forms came floating, wonderfully fair—a
brother and sister—their beautiful arms twined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
round one another, their golden hair bathed in sunlight,
and supported by the wind.</p>

<p>“My son and daughter,” said Niörd, proudly, to
the surrounding Æsir, “Frey and Freya, Summer
and Beauty, hand in hand.”</p>

<p>When Frey and Freya dropped upon the hill
Niörd took his son by the hand, led him gracefully
to the foot of the throne, and said, “Look here, dear
brother Lord, what a fair young instructor I have
brought for your pretty little elves.”</p>

<p>Odin was very much pleased with the appearance
of Frey; but, before constituting him king and
schoolmaster of the light elves, he desired to know
what his accomplishments were, and what he considered
himself competent to teach.</p>

<p>“I am the genius of clouds and sunshine,” answered
Frey; and as he spoke, the essences of a
hundred perfumes were exhaled from his breath.
“I am the genius of clouds and sunshine, and if the
light elves will have me for their king I can teach
them how to burst the folded buds, to set the blossoms,
to pour sweetness into the swelling fruit, to
lead the bees through the honey-passages of the
flowers, to make the single ear a stalk of wheat, to
hatch birds’ eggs, and teach the little ones to sing—all
this, and much more,” said Frey, “I know, and
will teach them.”</p>

<p>Then answered Odin, “It is well;” and Frey
took his scholars away with him to Alfheim, which
is in every beautiful place under the sun.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_THOR_WENT_TO_JOTUNHEIM">HOW THOR WENT TO JÖTUNHEIM</h2>

<p class="author">By A. and E. Keary</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once on a time, Asa Thor and Loki set out
on a journey from Asgard to Jötunheim.
They travelled in Thor’s chariot, drawn by two
milk-white goats. It was a somewhat cumbrous
iron chariot, and the wheels made a rumbling noise
as it moved, which sometimes startled the ladies of
Asgard, and made them tremble; but Thor liked it,
thought the noise sweeter than any music, and was
never so happy as when he was journeying in it
from one place to another.</p>

<p>They travelled all day, and in the evening they
came to a countryman’s house. It was a poor,
lonely place; but Thor descended from his chariot,
and determined to pass the night there. The
countryman, however, had no food in his house to
give these travellers; and Thor, who liked to feast
himself and make every one feast with him, was
obliged to kill his own two goats and serve them up
for supper. He invited the countryman and his
wife and children to sup with him; but before they
began to eat he made one request of them.</p>

<p>“Do not, on any account,” he said, “break or
throw away any of the bones of the goats you are
going to eat for supper.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why,” said the peasant’s son, Thialfi,
to his sister Roska. Roska could not think of any
reason, and by-and-bye Thialfi happened to have
a very nice little bone given him with some marrow
in it. “Certainly there can be no harm in my breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
just this one,” he said to himself; “it would be
such a pity to lose the marrow;” and as Asa Thor’s
head was turned another way, he slyly broke the
bone in two, sucked the marrow, and then threw the
pieces into the goat’s skins, where Thor had desired
that all the bones might be placed. I do not know
whether Thialfi was uneasy during the night about
what he had done; but in the morning he found out
the reason of Asa Thor’s command, and received
a lesson on “wondering why,” which he never forgot
all his life after.</p>

<p>As soon as Asa Thor rose in the morning he
took his hammer, Miölnir, in his hand, and held it
over the goat-skins as they lay on the floor, whispering
runes the while. They were dead skins with
dry bones on them when he began to speak; but as
he said the last word, Thialfi, who was looking
curiously on, saw two live goats spring up and walk
toward the chariot, as fresh and well as when they
brought the chariot up to the door, Thialfi hoped.
But no; one of the goats limped a little with his
hind leg, and Asa Thor saw it. His brow grew
dark as he looked, and for a minute Thialfi thought
he would run far, far into the forest, and never
come back again; but one look more at Asa Thor’s
face, angry as it was, made him change his mind.
He thought of a better thing to do than running
away. He came forward, threw himself at the
Asa’s feet, and, confessing what he had done,
begged pardon for his disobedience. Thor listened,
and the displeased look passed away from his face.</p>

<p>“You have done wrong, Thialfi,” he said, raising
him up; “but as you have confessed your fault so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bravely, instead of punishing you, I will take you
with me on my journey, and teach you myself the
lesson of obedience to the Æsir which is, I see,
wanted.”</p>

<p>Roska chose to go with her brother, and from
that day Thor had two faithful servants, who followed
him wherever he went.</p>

<p>The chariot and goats were now left behind; but,
with Loki and his two new followers, Thor journeyed
on to the end of Manheim, over the sea, and
then on, on, on in the strange, barren, misty land
of Jötunheim. Sometimes they crossed great mountains;
sometimes they had to make their way among
torn and rugged rocks, which often, through the
mist, appeared to them to wear the forms of men,
and once for a whole day they traversed a thick
and tangled forest.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day, being very much
tired, they saw with pleasure that they had come
upon a spacious hall, of which the door, as broad
as the house itself, stood wide open.</p>

<p>“Here we may very comfortably lodge for the
night,” said Thor; and they went in and looked
about them.</p>

<p>The house appeared to be perfectly empty; there
was a wide hall, and five smaller rooms opening into
it. They were, however, too tired to examine it
carefully, and as no inhabitants made their appearance,
they ate their supper in the hall, and lay
down to sleep. But they had not rested long before
they were disturbed by strange noises, groanings,
mutterings, and snortings, louder than any animal
that they had ever seen in their lives could make.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
By-and-bye the house began to shake from side to
side, and it seemed as if the very earth trembled.
Thor sprang up in haste, and ran to the open door;
but, though he looked earnestly into the starlit
forest, there was no enemy to be seen anywhere.
Loki and Thialfi, after groping about for a time,
found a sheltered chamber to the right, where they
thought they could finish their night’s rest in safety;
but Thor, with Miölnir in his hand, watched at
the door of the house all night. As soon as the day
dawned he went out into the forest, and there,
stretched on the ground close by the house, he saw
a strange, uncouth, gigantic shape of a man, out of
whose nostrils came a breath which swayed the trees
to their very tops. There was no need to wonder
any longer what the disturbing noises had
been.</p>

<p>Thor fearlessly walked up to this strange monster
to have a better look at him; but at the sound
of his footsteps the giant-shape rose slowly, stood
up an immense height, and looked down upon Thor
with two great misty eyes, like blue mountain-lakes.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said Thor, standing on tiptoe,
and stretching his neck to look up; “and why do
you make such a noise as to prevent your neighbors
from sleeping?”</p>

<p>“My name is Skrymir,” said the giant sternly;
“I need not ask yours. You are the little Asa
Thor of Asgard; but pray, now, what have you
done with my glove?”</p>

<p>As he spoke he stooped down, and picked up
the hall where Thor and his companions had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
passed the night, and which, in truth, was nothing
more than his glove, the room where Loki and
Thialfi had slept being the thumb.</p>

<p>Thor rubbed his eyes, and felt as if he must
be dreaming. Rousing himself, however, he raised
Miölnir in his hand, and, trying to keep his eyes
fixed on the giant’s face, which seemed to be
always changing, he said: “It is time that you
should know, Skrymir, that I am come to Jötunheim
to fight and conquer such evil giants as you
are, and, little as you think me, I am ready to try
my strength against yours.”</p>

<p>“Try it, then,” said the giant.</p>

<p>And Thor, without another word, threw Miölnir
at his head.</p>

<p>“Ah! Ah!” said the giant; “did a leaf touch
me?”</p>

<p>Again Thor seized Miölnir, which always returned
to his hand, however far he cast it from
him, and threw it with all his force.</p>

<p>The giant put up his hand to his forehead. “I
think,” he said, “that an acorn must have fallen
on my head.”</p>

<p>A third time Thor struck a blow, the heaviest
that ever fell from the hand of an Asa; but this
time the giant laughed out loud.</p>

<p>“There is surely a bird on that tree,” he said,
“who has let a feather fall on my face.”</p>

<p>Then, without taking any further notice of Thor,
he swung an immense wallet over his shoulder, and,
turning his back upon him, struck into a path that
led from the forest. When he had gone a little
way he looked round, his immense face appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
less like a human countenance than some strange,
uncouthly-shaped stone toppling on a mountain
precipice.</p>

<p>“Ving-Thor,”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he said, “let me give you a piece
of good advice before I go. When you get to
Utgard don’t make much of yourself. You think
me a tall man, but you have taller still to see; and
you yourself are a very little mannikin. Turn back
home whence you came, and be satisfied to have
learned something of yourself by your journey to
Jötunheim.”</p>

<p>“Mannikin or not, <em>that</em> will I never do,” shouted
Asa Thor after the giant. “We will meet again,
and something more will we learn, or teach each
other.”</p>

<p>The giant, however, did not turn back to answer,
and Thor and his companions, after looking for
some time after him, resumed their journey. Before
the sun was quite high in the heavens they came
out of the forest, and at noon they found themselves
on a vast barren plain, where stood a great city,
whose walls of dark, rough stone were so high,
that Thor had to bend his head quite far back to
see the top of them. When they approached the
entrance of this city they found that the gates were
closed and barred; but the space between the bars
was so large that Thor passed through easily, and
his companions followed him. The streets of the
city were gloomy and still. They walked on for
some time without meeting any one; but at length
they came to a very high building, of which the
gates stood open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us go in and see what is going on here,”
said Thor; and they went.</p>

<p>After crossing the threshold they found themselves
in an immense banqueting hall. A table
stretched from one end to the other of it; stone
thrones stood round the table, and on every throne
sat a giant, each one, as Thor glanced round, appearing
more grim, and cold, and stony than the
rest. One among them sat on a raised seat, and
appeared to be the chief; so to him Thor approached
and paid his greetings.</p>

<p>The giant chief just glanced at him, and, without
rising, said, in a somewhat careless manner: “It
is, I think, a foolish custom to tease tired travellers
with questions about their journey. I know without
asking that you, little fellow, are Asa Thor.
Perhaps, however, you may be in reality taller than
you appear; and as it is a rule here that no one
shall sit down to table till he has performed some
wonderful feat, let us hear what you and your
followers are famed for, and in what way you
choose to prove yourselves worthy to sit down in
the company of giants.”</p>

<p>At this speech, Loki, who had entered the hall
cautiously behind Thor, pushed himself forward.</p>

<p>“The feat for which I am most famed,” he said,
“is eating, and it is one which I am just now
inclined to perform with right good will. Put food
before me, and let me see if any of your followers
can dispatch it as quickly as I can.”</p>

<p>“The feat you speak of is one by no means to be
despised,” said the Utgard king, “and there is one
here who would be glad to try his powers against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
yours. Let Logi,” he said to one of his followers,
“be summoned to the hall.”</p>

<p>At this, a tall, thin, yellow-faced man approached,
and a large trough of meat having been
placed in the middle of the hall, Loki sat to work
at one end, and Logi at the other, and they began
to eat. I hope <em>I</em> shall never see any one eat as
they ate; but the giants all turned their slow-moving
eyes to watch them, and in a few minutes
they met in the middle of the trough. It seemed, at
first, as if they had both eaten exactly the same
quantity; but, when the thing came to be examined
into it was found that Loki had, indeed, eaten
up all the meat, but that Logi had also eaten the
bones and the trough. Then the giants nodded
their huge heads, and determined that Loki was
conquered. King Utgard now turned to Thialfi,
and asked what he could do.</p>

<p>“I was thought swift of foot among the youth
of my own country,” answered Thialfi; “and I will,
if you please, try to run a race with any one here.”</p>

<p>“You have chosen a noble sport, indeed,”
said the king; “but you must be a good runner
if you could beat him with whom I shall match
you.”</p>

<p>Then he called a slender lad, Hugi by name, and
the whole company left the hall, and, going out by
an opposite gate to that by which Thor had entered,
they came out to an open space, which made a
noble race-ground. There the goal was fixed, and
Thialfi and Hugi started off together.</p>

<p>Thialfi ran fast—fast as the reindeer which hears
the wolves howling behind; but Hugi ran so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
faster that, passing the goal, he turned round, and
met Thialfi half-way in the course.</p>

<p>“Try again, Thialfi,” cried the king; and Thialfi,
once more taking his place, flew along the
course, with feet scarcely touching the ground—swiftly
as an eagle when, from his mountain-crag,
he swoops on his prey in the valley; but with all
his running he was still a good bow-shot from the
goal when Hugi reached it.</p>

<p>“You are certainly a good runner,” said the
king; “but if you mean to win you must do a
little better still than this; but perhaps you wish
to surprise us all the more this third time.”</p>

<p>The third time, however, Thialfi was wearied,
and though he did his best, Hugi, having reached
the goal, turned and met him not far from the
starting-point.</p>

<p>The giants again looked at each other, and
declared that there was no need of further trial, for
that Thialfi was conquered.</p>

<p>It was now Asa Thor’s turn, and all the company
looked eagerly at him, while the Utgard king
asked by what wonderful feat he chose to distinguish
himself.</p>

<p>“I will try a drinking-match with any of you,”
Thor said, shortly; for, to tell the truth, he cared
not to perform anything very worthy in the company
in which he found himself.</p>

<p>King Utgard appeared pleased with this choice,
and when the giants had resumed their seats in
the hall, he ordered one of his servants to bring
in his drinking-cup, called the “cup of penance,”
which it was his custom to make his guests drain at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a draught, if they had broken any of the ancient
rules of the society.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, handing it to Thor, “we call
it well drunk if a person empties it at a single
draught. Some, indeed, take two to it; but the
very puniest can manage it in three.”</p>

<p>Thor looked into the cup; it appeared to him
long, but not so very large after all, and being
thirsty he put it to his lips, and thought to make
short work of it, and empty it at one good, hearty
pull. He drank, and put the cup down again;
but, instead of being empty, it was now just so
full that it could be moved without danger of
spilling.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! You are keeping all your strength
for the second pull, I see,” said Utgard, looking
in. Without answering, Thor lifted the cup again,
and drank with all his might till his breath failed;
but, when he put down the cup, the liquor had only
sunk down a little from the brim.</p>

<p>“If you mean to take three draughts to it,” said
Utgard, “you are really leaving yourself a very
unfair share for the last time. Look to yourself,
Ving-Thor; for, if you do not acquit yourself better
in other feats, we shall not think so much of you
here as they say the Æsir do in Asgard.”</p>

<p>At this speech Thor fell angry, and, seizing the
cup again, he drank a third time, deeper and longer
than he had yet done; but, when he looked into
the cup, he saw that a very small part only of its
contents had disappeared. Wearied and disappointed
he put the cup down, and said he would
try no more to empty it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is pretty plain,” said the king, looking round
on the company, “that Asa Thor is by no means
the kind of man we always supposed him to be.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Thor, “I am willing to try another
feat, and you yourselves shall choose what it
shall be.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the king, “there is a game at which
our children are used to play. A short time ago I
dare not have named it to Asa Thor; but now I
am curious to see how he will acquit himself in it.
It is merely to lift my cat from the ground—a
childish amusement truly.”</p>

<p>As he spoke a large, grey cat sprang into the
hall, and Thor, stooping forward, put his hand
under it to lift it up. He tried gently at first; but
by degrees he put forth all his strength, tugging
and straining as he had never done before; but the
utmost he could do was to raise one of the cat’s
paws a little way from the ground.</p>

<p>“It is just as I thought,” said King Utgard,
looking round with a smile; “but we all are willing
to allow that the cat is large, and Thor but a
little fellow.”</p>

<p>“Little as you think me,” cried Thor, “who is
there who will dare to wrestle with me in my
anger?”</p>

<p>“In truth,” said the king, “I don’t think there
is any one here who would choose to wrestle with
you; but, if wrestle you must, I will call in that
old crone Elli. She has, in her time, laid low many
a better man than Asa Thor has shown himself
to be.”</p>

<p>The crone came. She was old, withered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
toothless, and Thor shrank from the thought of
wrestling with her; but he had no choice. She
threw her arms round him, and drew him toward
the ground, and the harder he tried to free himself,
the tighter grew her grasp. They struggled long.
Thor strove bravely, but a strange feeling of weakness
and weariness came over him, and at length
he tottered and fell down on one knee before her.
At this sight all the giants laughed aloud, and
Utgard coming up, desired the old woman to leave
the hall, and proclaimed that the trials were over.
No one of his followers would <em>now</em> contend with
Asa Thor, he said, and night was approaching. He
then invited Thor and his companions to sit down
at the table, and spend the night with him as his
guests. Thor, though feeling somewhat perplexed
and mortified, accepted his invitation courteously,
and showed, by his agreeable behavior during the
evening, that he knew how to bear being conquered
with a good grace.</p>

<p>In the morning, when Thor and his companions
were leaving the city, the king himself accompanied
them without the gates; and Thor, looking steadily
at him when he turned to bid him farewell, perceived,
for the first time, that he was the very same
Giant Skrymir with whom he had met in the forest.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Asa Thor,” said the giant with a
strange sort of smile on his face, “tell me truly,
before you go, how you think your journey has
turned out, and whether or not I was right in
saying that you would meet with better men than
yourself in Jötunheim.”</p>

<p>“I confess freely,” answered Asa Thor, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
up without any false shame on his face, “that
I have acquitted myself but humbly, and it
grieves me; for I know that in Jötunheim henceforward
it will be said that I am a man of little
worth.”</p>

<p>“By my troth! no,” cried the giant, heartily.
“Never should you have come into my city if
I had known what a mighty man of valor you
really are; and now that you are safely out of
it, I will, for once, tell the truth to you, Thor.
All this time I have been deceiving you by my
enchantments. When you met me in the forest,
and hurled Miölnir at my head, I should have been
crushed by the weight of your blows had I not
skilfully placed a mountain between myself and
you, on which the strokes of your hammer fell, and
where you cleft three deep ravines, which shall
henceforth become verdant valleys. In the same
manner I deceived you about the contests in which
you engaged last night. When Loki and Logi sat
down before the trough, Loki, indeed, ate like
hunger itself; but Logi is fire, who, with eager, consuming
tongue, licked up both bones and trough.
Thialfi is the swiftest of mortal runners; but the
slender lad, Hugi, was my thought; and what speed
can ever equal his? So it was in your own trials.
When you took such deep draughts from the horn,
you little knew what a wonderful feat you were
performing. The other end of that horn reached
the ocean, and when you come to the shore you will
see how far its waters have fallen away, and how
much the deep sea itself has been diminished by
your draught. Hereafter, men watching the going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
out of the tide will call it the ebb, or draught of
Thor.</p>

<p>“Scarcely less wonderful was the prowess you
displayed in the second trial. What appeared
to you to be a cat, was, in reality, the Midgard serpent,
which encircles the world. When we saw you
succeed in moving it we trembled lest the very
foundations of earth and sea should be shaken by
your strength. Nor need you be ashamed of having
been overthrown by the old woman Elli, for she
is old age; and there never has, and never will
be, one whom she has not the power to lay low.
We must now part, and you had better not come
here again, or attempt anything further against
my city; for I shall always defend it by fresh enchantments,
and you will never be able to do anything
against me.”</p>

<p>At these words Thor raised Miölnir, and was
about to challenge the giant to a fresh trial of
strength; but, before he could speak, Utgard vanished
from his sight; and, turning round to look
for the city, he found that it, too, had disappeared,
and that he was standing alone on a smooth, green,
empty plain.</p>

<p>“What a fool I have been,” said Asa Thor, aloud,
“to allow myself to be deceived by a mountain
giant!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” answered a voice from above, “I told you,
you would learn to know yourself better by your
journey to Jötunheim. It is the great use of travelling.”</p>

<p>Thor turned quickly round again, thinking to see
Skrymir behind him; but, after looking on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
side, he could perceive nothing, but that a high,
cloud-capped mountain, which he had noticed on
the horizon, appeared to have advanced to the edge
of the plain.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_THORS_HAMMER_WAS_LOST">HOW THOR’S HAMMER WAS LOST
AND FOUND</h2>

<p class="author">By E. M. Wilmot-Buxton</p>

<p class="dropcap">Most precious in the eyes of Thor was his
magic hammer, Miölnir, of which even the
mighty Frost Giants stood in dread.</p>

<p>Always he laid it by his side when he went to
rest, and always it was the first thing for which his
hand was outstretched when he awoke. Judge then
of his horror and dismay when, on opening his eyes
one morning, the hammer was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Starting up with a roar of rage, Thor commenced
to search everywhere for the missing weapon. Up
and down his wonderful palace, built of the thunder
clouds, he tramped, with a noise that shook the
whole city of Asgard. But the hammer was not to
be found.</p>

<p>Then he called upon golden-haired Sif, his wife,
and bade her help in the search; and still the hammer
was nowhere to be seen. It was clear that
someone must have stolen it, and, when he realized
this, Thor’s wrath broke all bounds. His bristling
red hair and beard stood up on end, and from them
flew a whole volley of fiery sparks.</p>

<p>Presently, as the angry Asa was shaking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
palace with his thunderous voice, Red Loki came
along to inquire into the trouble. He was not
likely to sympathize with Thor, but, always brimful
of curiosity, he loved to have a part in everything
that happened.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Asa Thor?” said he; and
Thor replied, lowering his voice as he spoke, for he
did not want his loss to be too widely known:</p>

<p>“Now listen to what I tell thee, Loki—’tis a thing
which is known neither on earth below nor in
heaven above. My hammer’s gone.”</p>

<p>This news was most interesting to Loki, who had
long owed Thor a grudge, which he was afraid to
pay openly. “Ho, ho!” said he. “Then shall we
soon have the giants turning us out of Asgard,
brother Thor.”</p>

<p>“Not if you use your wits as you know how,”
growled Thor, still in a very bad temper. “Come,
you call yourself a clever fellow. Find out for me
who has robbed me of my thunderbolt, my hammer,
my Miölnir.”</p>

<p>Then Loki gave a grin and a wink, and promised
to do what he could—not because he cared for
Thor, but because he loved to be of importance,
and was, moreover, really frightened as to what
might happen to Asgard if the magic hammer was
not at hand.</p>

<p>It was not long before he noticed that an extraordinary
kind of tempest was raging in the regions
below—not an orderly kind of tempest, with first
some thunder, and then some rain, and then a gust
of wind or two, such as Thor was wont to arrange,
but a mixture of hail and wind and thunder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
lightning and rain and snow, all raging together in
a tremendous muddle, so that the earth folk
thought the end of the world was come.</p>

<p>This gave Loki a hint, and he began to peer
about between the clouds, until at length he saw
that the trouble was coming from a certain hill
which stood in the center of Giantland.</p>

<p>Now on the top of this hill lived a certain Thrym,
prince of the Frost Giants, who for a long time past
had been very envious of the might of Thor. He
had, indeed, done his best to imitate him as far as
he could, and had managed to get up a very good
imitation of lightning and hail and rain; but he had
not been able to manage the thunderbolts, for they
could only be made by means of Thor’s hammer,
Miölnir.</p>

<p>All this was well known to Red Loki, and he was
therefore not at all surprised to find that, somehow
or other, Thrym must have got hold of the magic
weapon; for here were thunderbolts crashing about
the earth and sky at a terrible rate.</p>

<p>When informed of the discovery, Thor flew into
a still more tremendous rage, and wanted to rush
off at once to try conclusions with the giant. But
Loki, who loved rather to get a thing by trickery
and deceit, persuaded him that violence would never
do.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said he, “that Thrym <em>with</em> the
hammer is much stronger than Thor without it.
This is a matter which must be managed by clever
wit and craft, not by force and loud talking. Leave
therefore the whole matter to me.”</p>

<p>To this Thor very reluctantly agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Loki bethought him of some disguise
wherein he might visit Giantland in safety, for he
was not at all anxious to risk his life. He betook
himself to the House of Maidens, over which ruled
Freya, fairest of all in Asgard, she who was wont
to shake the spring flowers from her golden locks
as she passed over the frozen uplands, leaving
behind her a region of green and smiling beauty.
Loki found the goddess, and begged the loan of
her magic falcon plumes, in which she was wont
to flit to and fro over the earth; and when she
learnt for what purpose he needed them she gladly
assented.</p>

<p>Then Loki took the appearance of a great brown
bird, and spreading his wings he flew away toward
Giantland.</p>

<p>It was a long journey, as he already knew, and,
although the tempest had now ceased to rage, he
found the country of the giants darker and colder
and drearier than ever.</p>

<p>The longest journey comes to an end, and at
length Loki reached a mountain where sat the Giant
Thrym, his huge legs dangling to the ground,
playing with a puppy as large as an elephant.</p>

<p>Perching as near as he dared, Loki gazed at the
giant with his bright, round eyes, and was wondering
how to begin, when Thrym, who, at a glance,
had seen completely through his disguise, said
calmly, in a voice as much as possible like Thor’s
thunderous roar: “Oh, ho! Loki, what are you
doing so far from Asgard? Are you not afraid,
little fellow as you are, to venture alone into our
country?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Loki, thinking to win his way by flattery,
replied: “Sad indeed is it in Asgard, now that
Miölnir has vanished. Clever was that one who
spirited it away from the very side of Thor. Methinks
none but you could have done it, O mighty
Thrym!”</p>

<p>Pleased with the compliment to his cleverness
the giant chuckled before admitting: “Ay, Loki,
the hammer is mine, ’tis very true; and now men
will know who really is the Thunderer.”</p>

<p>“Ah well!” sighed cunning Loki, “some men are
strong by reason of their weapons, and some are
just as strong without. Small need have you, O
mighty Thrym, for hammers, but Thor is naught
without it. Yet, since all the world knows that
you are his master, let him have his plaything back,
that we may cease to be troubled by his peevish
outcry.”</p>

<p>But though Thrym was as stupid as he was big,
he was not to be caught thus.</p>

<p>“No, no, my little Loki,” he said. “Mine is the
hammer, and deep have I buried it beneath the
bottom of the sea. Go, tell this to your Asa folk,
and say to them that I will give it back on one
condition only—and that is, that they send me
Freya, that fairest of maidens, to be my wife.”</p>

<p>At this suggestion Loki could scarcely keep from
laughing, for the idea of sending the beautiful
Freya, the joy and delight of Asgard, to be the
wife of this ill-favored Frost Giant was too absurd
for words.</p>

<p>It was not much to him, however, what happened
to anyone except himself, so he hastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
reply: “Be sure, O Thrym, that everything I can
do to further the matter shall be done. And if
Freya is of the same mind as I you will soon be
welcoming that most sweet maiden to Giantland—farewell!”</p>

<p>So saying, he spread his brown wings and flew
back to Asgard, delighted to think of the mischief
he could now set brewing.</p>

<p>First of all he visited Thor, and told him of what
had passed. And the Thunderer, when he heard
of Thrym’s boastful words, was filled with wild
wrath and wanted to start off, then and there, and
wrest the hammer from the depths of the sea. But
Loki pointed out the difficulties that stood in the
way and, leaving the Asa to ponder over his words,
he hurried off to Freya and informed her of
Thrym’s proposal.</p>

<p>The beautiful Freya was walking in her garden,
and round her neck she wore her famous necklet
of stars. When she heard Loki’s suggestion that
she should wed a hideous giant she fell into such
a rage that she broke her necklet, and all the
stars went falling through the sky, so that men
cried:</p>

<p>“See how the stars are shooting!”</p>

<p>Meantime the Asa folk had met together to consider
all that had happened, and, having calmed the
fury of Thor, they pointed out to him that Asgard
stood in the gravest danger of an attack which
would find them quite unprotected. When they
had said this several times over, Thor began to
weary of the subject, and he replied with great surliness:
“Very well, then. Let Freya go to Thrym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as his wife, and then shall we be as before, with
Miölnir to defend us.”</p>

<p>When Freya heard this, her rage turned to tears
and lamentations, and she declared that it would
be death to her to send her to the gloomy halls of
Giantland, whence she could never hope to revisit
the flowery meads and grassy slopes of Asgard.
And the Asas, unable to bear the sight of her grief,
with one voice declared that they would never spare
her from the Home of Bliss.</p>

<p>Then there stepped forward Heimdall, the
watchman who sits on guard over the Rainbow
Bridge by night and day.</p>

<p>Now Heimdall had the gift of seeing into the
future, and the Asas were always ready to hear
his words, well knowing them to be wise.</p>

<p>“My plan is this,” said he. “Let Thor borrow
the clothes of Freya and put a thick veil over his
face; and let him go thus to Thrym’s castle and
pass for his bride. And if he cannot by some
means manage to get hold of the hammer when
he is there—why, he must give it up altogether.”</p>

<p>At this suggestion the Asas clapped their hands
with approval—all, indeed, save Thor, who looked
most glum, and was extremely unwilling to agree
to the plan.</p>

<p>“Dress me as a bride!” he grumbled. “A pretty
maiden I shall make. Ready enough am I to fight,
but I will not make myself a laughing-stock if I
know it.”</p>

<p>But the Asas besought him to give way, while
Loki twitted him with cowardice. Fair Freya, too,
appealed with tearful eyes; and so at length, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
great reluctance, the Thunderer agreed to do what
they wished.</p>

<p>Fortunately the maiden Freya was very tall, but
even so it was with some difficulty that they managed
to cover the burly form of Thor with her
robes.</p>

<p>He insisted, moreover, upon wearing his own
shirt of mail and his girdle of strength; and these
took much drapery to hide. Great was the laughter
in the halls of Asgard that night as the Battle
Maidens brushed and curled Thor’s long yellow
hair, and set a jewelled headdress upon it; and
finally, when the maidens proceeded to cover up
his thick heard and angry eyes with a silken veil,
the mirth of the Asas was unrestrained. To complete
the disguise the maidens hung round his neck
the famous necklet, which had now been re-strung,
and finally Frigga, the wife of All-Father Odin,
secured at his girdle the great bunch of keys proper
to brides at a wedding in the Northland.</p>

<p>While this was being done, Loki, more than all,
had been convulsed with merriment at the success
of his mischief-making. The very sight of Thor’s
disgusted looks, and of his great hands clenched
with rage under the delicate veil, nearly killed him
with laughter; and when all was ready he declared
himself unable to lose an atom of the fun in store.</p>

<p>“Let me go with you,” he implored. “See, I will
dress myself as your hand-maiden. Ah, you had
better agree, for without me to prompt you, you
will never play your part.”</p>

<p>So Loki was dressed as a waiting-maid, and took
his seat very demurely by the side of Thor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
goat-car. Loud was the laughter in Asgard as the
Asas watched the two drive off together and heard
the roar of the Thunderer’s voice issuing from the
folds of a meek maiden’s veil as he urged his goats
upon their course. Long and stormy was that ride
to Giantland, for Thor was still in the worst of
tempers, and drove his chariot so furiously that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The mountains crashed</div>
<div class="verse">The earth stood in flames,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as the hoofs of the goats clattered over mountains
and waters, striking sparks wherever they touched
a rock.</p>

<p>Thrym was much overjoyed when he heard that
a chariot containing the two maidens was approaching
his door. Away ran his servants in different
directions, some with orders to make ready a grand
banquet, some to prepare the chamber of the brides
some to receive her at the door.</p>

<p>The giant himself assisted them to alight, and
looked with admiration at the stately figure of his
bride; but he made no attempt to see her face,
since it is the custom in the Northland for the bride
to remain veiled until the marriage has been completed.</p>

<p>“A bride worthy of a giant!” murmured his servants,
as he led her to a lofty seat beside his own
great throne of gold; and they looked with approval
also on the buxom form of the waiting-maid,
who stood, closely veiled, behind her mistress’s
chair.</p>

<p>Now the journey had been long and cold, and it
was with joy that the new-comers noticed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
preparations for the banquet were complete, for
they were exceedingly hungry.</p>

<p>The giants are huge eaters, and they gathered
round the board whereon were displayed an enormous
ox roasted whole, a vast dish of salmon and
various other dainties. But because the bride was
a woman, and modest withal, they brought her tiny
morsels on a dainty golden plate.</p>

<p>This was too much for Thor, who had always
possessed a most healthy appetite, and was now
more than usually ready for his supper. Gradually
drawing nearer to the table, while the others were
busy with the meal, he managed to get hold of the
dish of roasted ox, and within a few minutes the
whole of the animal had disappeared.</p>

<p>Then he put out his hand to the platter of salmon,
and in eight mouthfuls disposed of eight of the
great fish. After this he noticed a large plate full
of cakes and sweetmeats, which was set apart for
the ladies of the party. Of these, too, he made
short work.</p>

<p>Finally, feeling thirsty after his huge meal,
he took up two barrels of mead, and tossed
them off, one after another, down his capacious
throat. Then he sat back on his chair with a sigh
of deep content.</p>

<p>These proceedings had been watched by Loki
with uneasiness, but by Thrym with open-mouthed
dismay. Was this the usual appetite of this dainty
maiden, who had eaten more than the company of
giants? But Loki bent toward him and whispered
in his ear that the thought of marrying had so excited
Freya that she had eaten nothing for eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
days, and had therefore been on the point of
starvation.</p>

<p>This reassured the giant, and being now himself
filled with mead he drew nearer and, lifting a corner
of the veil, tried to kiss the cheek of his future bride.</p>

<p>But Thor, who was longing to be at close grips
with him, threw him such a fiery glance that he
drew quickly back, saying: “Why does fair Freya’s
eye burn like a spark from a furnace?” “Pooh!”
whispered Loki again, “that is nothing but her love
for you, which for eight days has raged like a
flaming fire.”</p>

<p>This news was still more pleasant to hear, and
Thrym, in high good humor, cried: “Bring in the
hammer, my wedding gift, wherewith to plight the
maid. For when I have laid it on her lap she will be
my own forever, and together we will work dire evil
against the Asa folk, whom I hate with all my heart.”</p>

<p>What was that unmaidenly sound that issued
from under the silken veil at these words? But
though Loki turned pale to hear it, Thrym, busy
sending for the hammer, did not pay any heed.</p>

<p>Back came the giant’s servants at length, bending
under the weight of Miölnir. And as they
bowed before the silent maiden, sitting with meekly
bent head upon the throne, Thrym cried with a
merry jest: “See, here is little Thor’s tiny plaything—a
pretty toy truly for his feeble hands.
Take it, fair Freya, as my wedding gift.”</p>

<p>“And take <em>that</em> as mine!” roared Thor, in a voice
of thunder, as he flung off the veil and rose to his
full height. And with the words he swung the
hammer once—and ere the eye could follow its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
movement, it had crashed through Thrym’s skull,
and had knocked over a round dozen of his guests.
Yet again did it swing in the Asa’s hand, and this
time it left not a giant standing in the hall.</p>

<p>A third time it was swung, and on this occasion
the roof and walls of the palace came tumbling on
every side, and only Thor and Loki were left alive
amid the ruins.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Red Loki, “that was neatly
done, fair Freya.”</p>

<p>Thor, who was now busily tearing off the hated
robes and veil, stayed to look threateningly at his
companion. “No more of that, Loki,” said he, “the
thing had to be done, ’tis true, but talk not to me
again of this woman’s work. We will remember
only that I am the Thunderer, and that my hammer
that was lost is found.”</p>

<p>So they drove back peacefully to Asgard.</p>

<p>And this is the end of the tale of How Thor’s
Hammer was lost and found.</p>

<h2 id="IDUNAS_APPLES_OF_YOUTH">IDUNA’S APPLES OF YOUTH</h2>

<p class="author">By A. and E. Keary</p>

<h3>I. REFLECTIONS IN THE WATER</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Of all the groves and gardens round the city of
Asgard—and they were many and beautiful—there
was none so beautiful as the one where
Iduna, the wife of Bragi, lived. It stood on the
south side of the hill, not far from Gladsheim, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it was called “Always Young,” because nothing
that grew there could ever decay, or become the
least bit older than it was on the day when Iduna
entered it. The trees wore always a tender, light
green color, as the hedges do in spring. The flowers
were mostly half-opened, and every blade of
grass bore always a trembling, glittering drop of
early dew. Brisk little winds wandered about the
grove, making the leaves dance from morning till
night and swaying backwards and forwards the
heads of the flowers.</p>

<p>“Blow away!” said the leaves to the wind, “for
we shall never be tired.”</p>

<p>“And you will never be old,” said the winds in
answer. And then the birds took up the chorus
and sang:</p>

<p>“Never tired and never old.”</p>

<p>Iduna, the mistress of the grove, was fit to live
among young birds, and tender leaves, and spring
flowers. She was so fair that when she bent over
the river to entice her swans to come to her, even
the stupid fish stood still in the water, afraid to
destroy so beautiful an image by swimming over
it; and when she held out her hand with bread for
the swans to eat, you would not have known it from
a water-lily—it was so wonderfully white.</p>

<p>Iduna never left her grove even to pay a visit
to her nearest neighbor, and yet she did not lead
by any means a dull life; for, besides having the
company of her husband, Bragi, who must have
been an entertaining person to live with (for he is
said to have known a story which never came to an
end, and yet which never grew wearisome), all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
heroes of Asgard made a point of coming to call
upon her every day. It was natural enough that they
should like to visit so beautiful a grove and so fair
a lady; and yet, to confess the truth, it was not quite
to see either the grove or Iduna that they came.</p>

<p>Iduna herself was well aware of this, and when
her visitors had chatted a short time with her, she
never failed to bring out from the innermost recess
of her bower a certain golden casket, and to request
as a favor, that her guests would not think of going
away till they had tasted her apples, which, she flattered
herself, had a better flavor than any other
fruit in the world.</p>

<p>It would have been quite unlike a hero of Asgard
to have refused such courtesy; and, besides, Iduna
was not as far wrong about her apples as hostesses
generally are, when they boast of the good things
on their tables.</p>

<p>There is no doubt her apples <em>had</em> a peculiar
flavor; and if any one of the heroes happened to be
a little tired, or a little out of spirits, or a little cross,
when they came into the bower, it always followed
that, as soon as he had eaten one apple, he found
himself as fresh, and vigorous, and happy as he
had ever been in his life.</p>

<p>So fond were the heroes of these apples, and
so necessary did they think them to their daily comfort,
that they never went on a journey without
requesting Iduna to give them one or two, to fortify
them against the fatigues of the way.</p>

<p>Iduna had no difficulty in complying with this
request; she had no fear of her store ever failing,
for as surely as she took an apple from her casket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
another fell in; but where it came from Iduna could
never discover. She never saw it till it was close
to the bottom of the casket; but she always heard
the sweet tinkling sound it made when it touched
the golden rim. It was as good as play to stand by
her casket, taking the apples out, and watching
the fresh rosy ones come tumbling in, without
knowing who threw them.</p>

<p>One spring morning Iduna was very busy taking
apples out of her casket; for several of the heroes
were taking advantage of the fine weather to journey
out into the world. Bragi was going from
home for a time; perhaps he was tired of telling his
story only to Iduna, and perhaps she was beginning
to know it by heart; and Odin, Loki, and Hœnir
had agreed to take a little tour in the direction of
Jötunheim, just to see if any entertaining adventure
would befall them. When they had all received
their apples, and taken a tender farewell of Iduna,
the grove—green and fair as it was—looked, perhaps,
a little solitary.</p>

<p>Iduna stood by her fountain, watching the bright
water as it danced up into the air and quivered, and
turned, and fell back, making a hundred little flashing
circles in the river; and then she grew tired,
for once, of the light and the noise, and wandered
down to a still place, where the river was shaded by
low bushes on each side, and reflected clearly the
blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>Iduna sat down and looked into the deep water.
Besides her own fair face there were little, wandering,
white clouds to be seen reflected there. She
counted them as they sailed past. At length a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
strange form was reflected up to her from the water—large,
dark, lowering wings, pointed claws, a head
with fierce eyes—looking at her.</p>

<p>Iduna started and raised her head. It was above
as well as below; the same wings—the same eyes—the
same head—looking down from the blue sky,
as well as up from the water. Such a sight had
never been seen near Asgard before; and, while
Iduna looked, the thing waved its wings, and went
up, up, up, till it lessened to a dark spot in the
clouds, and on the river.</p>

<p>It was no longer terrible to look at; but, as it
shook its wings a number of little black feathers
fell from them, and flew down toward the grove.
As they neared the trees, they no longer looked
like feathers—each had two independent wings and
a head of its own; they were, in fact, a swarm of
Nervous Apprehensions; troublesome little insects
enough, and well known elsewhere, but which now,
for the first time, found their way into the grove.</p>

<p>Iduna ran away from them; she shook them off;
she fought quite bravely against them; but they
are by no means easy to get rid of; and when, at
last, one crept within the folds of her dress, and
twisted itself down to her heart, a new, strange
feeling thrilled there—a feeling never yet known
to any dweller in Asgard. Iduna did not know
what to make of it.</p>

<h3>II. THE WINGED-GIANT</h3>

<p class="dropcap">In the meantime Odin, Loki, and Hœnir proceeded
on their journey. They were not bound
on any particular quest. They strayed hither and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
thither that Odin might see that things were going
on well in the world, and his subjects comporting
themselves in a becoming manner. Every now and
then they halted while Odin inspected the thatching
of a barn, or stood at the smithy to see how
the smith wielded his hammer, or in a furrow to
observe if the ploughman guided his plough-share
evenly through the soil. “Well done,” he said if
the workman was working with all his might; and
he turned away, leaving something behind him, a
straw in the barn, a piece of old iron at the forge-door,
a grain in the furrow—nothing to look at; but
ever after the barn was always full, the forge-fire
never went out, the field yielded bountifully.</p>

<p>Toward noon the Æsir reached a shady valley,
and, feeling tired and hungry, Odin proposed to sit
down under a tree, and while he rested and studied
a book of runes which he had with him, he requested
Loki and Hœnir to prepare some dinner.</p>

<p>“I will undertake the meat and the fire,” said
Hœnir; “you, Loki, will like nothing better than
foraging about for what good things you can pick
up.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I mean to do,” said
Loki. “There is a farmhouse near here, from
which I can perceive a savory smell. It will be
strange, with my cunning, if I do not contrive to
have the best of all the dishes under this tree before
your fire is burnt up.”</p>

<p>As Loki spoke he turned a stone in his hand,
and immediately he assumed the shape of a large
black cat.</p>

<p>In this form he stole in at the kitchen-window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of a farmhouse, where a busy housewife was intent
on taking pies and cakes from a deep oven, and
ranging them on a dresser under the window. Loki
watched his opportunity, and whenever the mistress’s
back was turned he whisked a cake or a pie
out of the window.</p>

<p>“One, two, three. Why, there are fewer every
time I bring a fresh one from the oven!” cried the
bewildered housewife. “It’s that thieving cat. I
see the end of her tail on the window-sill.” Out of
the window leant the housewife to throw a stone at
the cat, but she could see nothing but a thin cow
trespassing in her garden; and when she ran out
with a stick to drive away the cow, it, too, had vanished,
and an old raven, with she young ones, was
flying over the garden-hedge.</p>

<p>The raven was Loki, the little ones were the pies;
and when he reached the valley, and changed himself
and them into their proper shapes, he had a
hearty laugh at his own cleverness, and at the old
woman’s dismay.</p>

<p>“Well done, Loki, king of thieves,” said a chorus
of foxes, who peeped out of their holes to see the
only one of the Æsir whose conduct they could appreciate;
but Odin, when he heard of it, was very
far from thinking it well done. He was extremely
displeased with Loki for having disgraced himself
by such mean tricks.</p>

<p>“It is true,” he said, “that my subjects may
well be glad to furnish me with all I require, but it
should be done knowingly. Return to the farmhouse,
and place these three black stones on the
table from whence you stole the provisions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Loki—unwilling as he was to do anything he believed
likely to bring good to others—was obliged
to obey. He made himself into the shape of a
white owl, flew once more through the window, and
dropped the stones out of his beak; they sank deep
into the table, and looked like three black stains on
the white deal-board.</p>

<p>From that time the housewife led an easy life;
there was no need for her to grind corn, or mix
dough, or prepare meat. Let her enter her kitchen
at what time of day she would, stores of provisions
stood smoking hot on the table. She kept
her own counsel about it, and enjoyed the reputation
of being the most economical housekeeper
in the whole country-side; but one thing disturbed
her mind, and prevented her thoroughly enjoying
the envy and wonder of the neighboring wives. All
the rubbing, and brushing, and cleaning in the
world would not remove the three black stains from
her kitchen table, and as she had no cooking to do,
she spent the greater part of her time in looking
at them.</p>

<p>“If they were but gone,” she said, a hundred
times every day, “I should be content; but how is
one to enjoy one’s life when one cannot rub the
stains off one’s own table?”</p>

<p>Perhaps Loki foresaw how the good wife would
use her gift; for he came back from the farmhouse
in the best spirits. “We will now, with Father
Odin’s permission, sit down to dinner,” he said;
“for surely, brother Hœnir, while I have been making
so many journeys to and fro, you have been
doing something with that fire which I see blazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
so fiercely, and with that old iron pot smoking
over it.”</p>

<p>“The meat will be by this time ready, no doubt,”
said Hœnir. “I killed a wild ox while you were
away, and part of it has been now for some time
stewing in the pot.”</p>

<p>The Æsir now seated themselves near the fire,
and Hœnir lifted up the lid of the pot. A thick
steam rose up from it; but when he took out the
meat it was as red and uncooked as when he first
put it into the pot.</p>

<p>“Patience,” said Hœnir; and Odin again took
out his book of runes. Another hour passed, and
Hœnir again took off the lid, and looked at the
meat; but it was in precisely the same state as before.
This happened several times, and even the
cunning Loki was puzzled; when, suddenly, a
strange noise was heard coming from a tree near,
and, looking up, they saw an enormous human-headed
eagle seated on one of the branches, and
looking at them with two fierce eyes. While they
looked it spoke.</p>

<p>“Give me my share of the feast,” it said, “and the
meat shall presently be done.”</p>

<p>“Come down and take it—it lies before you,”
said Loki, while Odin looked on with thoughtful
eyes; for he saw plainly that it was no mortal bird
who had the boldness to claim a share in the Æsir’s
food.</p>

<p>Undaunted by Odin’s majestic looks, the eagle
flew down, and, seizing a large piece of meat, was
going to fly away with it, when Loki, thinking he
had now got the bird in his power, took up a stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that lay near, and struck a hard blow on the eagle’s
back. The stick made a ringing sound as it fell;
but when Loki tried to draw it back, he found that
it stuck with extraordinary force to the eagle’s
back; neither could he withdraw his own hands
from the other end.</p>

<p>Something like a laugh came from the creature’s
half-human, half-bird-like mouth; and then it
spread its dark wings and rose up into the air, dragging
Loki after.</p>

<p>“It is as I thought,” said Odin, as he saw the
eagle’s enormous bulk brought out against the sky;
“it is Thiassi, the strongest giant in Jötunheim,
who has presumed to show himself in our presence.
Loki has only received the reward of his treachery,
and it would ill-become us to interfere in his behalf;
but, as the monster is near, it will be well for us to
return to Asgard, lest any misfortune should befall
the city in our absence.”</p>

<p>While Odin spoke, the winged creature had risen
up so high as to be invisible even to the eyes of the
Æsir; and, during their return to Asgard, he did
not again appear before them; but, as they approached
the gates of the city, they were surprised
to see Loki coming to meet them. He had a crest-fallen
and bewildered look; and when they questioned
him as to what had happened to him since
they parted in such a strange way, he declared
himself to be quite unable to give any further account
of his adventures than that he had been carried
rapidly through the air by the giant, and, at
last, thrown down from a great height near the
place where the Æsir met him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Odin looked steadfastly at him as he spoke, but
he forbore to question him further: for he knew
well that there was no hope of hearing the truth
from Loki, and he kept within his own mind the
conviction he felt that some disastrous result must
follow a meeting between two such evil-doers as
Loki and the giant Thiassi.</p>

<p>That evening, when the Æsir were all feasting
and telling stories to each other in the great hall
of Valhalla, Loki stole out from Gladsheim, and
went alone to visit Iduna in her grove. It was
a still, bright evening. The leaves of the trees
moved softly up and down, whispering sweet words
to each other; the flowers, with half-shut eyes, nodded
sleepily to their own reflections in the water,
and Iduna sat by the fountain, with her head resting
in one hand, thinking of pleasant things.</p>

<p>“It is all very well,” thought Loki; “but I am
not the happier because people can here live such
pleasant lives. It does not do me any good, or
cure the pain I have had so long in my heart.”</p>

<p>Loki’s long shadow—for the sun was setting—fell
on the water as he approached, and made Iduna
start. She remembered the sight that had disturbed
her so much in the morning; but when she saw only
Loki, she looked up and smiled kindly; for he had
often accompanied the other Æsir in their visits
to her grove.</p>

<p>“I am wearied with a long journey,” said Loki
abruptly, “and I would eat one of your apples to
refresh me after my fatigue.” The casket stood by
Iduna’s side, and she immediately put in her hand
and gave Loki an apple. To her surprise, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of thanking her warmly, or beginning to eat it, he
turned it round and round in his hand with a contemptuous
air.</p>

<p>“It is true then,” he said, after looking intently
at the apple for some time, “your apples are but
small and withered in comparison. I was unwilling
to believe it at first, but now I can doubt no longer.”</p>

<p>“Small and withered!” said Iduna, rising hastily.
“Nay, Asa Odin himself, who has traversed the
whole world, assures me that he has never seen any
to be compared to them.”</p>

<p>“That will never be said again,” returned Loki,
“for this very afternoon I have discovered a tree,
in a grove not far from Asgard, on which grow
apples so beautiful that no one who has seen them
will ever care again for yours.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to see or hear of them,” said
Iduna, trying to turn away with an indifferent air;
but Loki followed her, and continued to speak more
and more strongly of the beauty of this new fruit,
hinting that Iduna would be sorry that she had
refused to listen when she found all her guests deserting
her for the new grove, and when even
Bragi began to think lightly of her and of her gifts.
At this Iduna sighed, and Loki came up close to
her, and whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>“It is but a short way from Asgard, and the sun
has not yet set. Come out with me, and, before
any one else has seen the apples, you shall gather
them, and put them in your casket, and no woman
shall ever have it in her power to boast that she can
feast the Æsir more sumptuously than Iduna.”</p>

<p>Now Iduna had often been cautioned by her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
never to let anything tempt her to leave the
grove, and she had always been so happy here, that
she thought there was no use in his telling her the
same thing so often over; but now her mind was
so full of the wonderfully beautiful fruit, and she
felt such a burning wish to get it for herself, that
she quite forgot her husband’s commands.</p>

<p>“It is only a little way,” she said to herself; “there
can be no harm in going out just this once;” and, as
Loki went on urging her, she took up her basket
from the ground hastily, and begged him to show
her the way to this other grove. Loki walked very
quickly, and Iduna had not time to collect her
thoughts before she found herself at the entrance
of Always Young. At the gate she would gladly
have stopped a minute to take breath; but Loki
took hold of her hand, and forced her to pass
through, though, at the very moment of passing,
she half drew back; for it seemed to her as if all the
trees in the grove suddenly called out in alarm,
“Come back, come back, oh, come back, Iduna!”
She half drew back her hand, but it was too late;
the gate fell behind her, and she and Loki stood together
without the grove.</p>

<p>The trees rose up between them and the setting
sun, and cast a deep shadow on the place where
they stood; a cold, night air blew on Iduna’s cheek,
and made her shiver.</p>

<p>“Let us hasten on,” she said to Loki; “let us
hasten on, and soon come back again.”</p>

<p>But Loki was not looking on, he was looking up.
Iduna raised her eyes in the direction of his, and her
heart died within her; for there, high up over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
head, just as she had seen it in the morning, hung
the lowering, dark wings—the sharp talons—the
fierce head, looking at her. For one moment it
stood still above her head, and then lower, lower,
lower, the huge shadow fell; and, before Iduna
found breath to speak, the dark wings were folded
round her, and she was borne high up in the air,
northwards, towards the gray mist that hangs over
Jötunheim. Loki watched till she was out of sight,
and then returned to Asgard. The presence of the
giant was no wonder to him; for he had, in truth,
purchased his own release by promising to deliver
up Iduna and her casket into his power; but, as he
returned alone through the grove, a foreboding
fear pressed on his mind.</p>

<p>“If it should be true,” he thought, “that Iduna’s
apples have the wonderful power Odin attributes
to them! if I among the rest should suffer from
the loss!”</p>

<p>Occupied with these thoughts, he passed quickly
among the trees, keeping his eyes resolutely fixed
on the ground. He dare not trust himself to look
around; for once, when he had raised his head, he
fancied that, gliding through the brushwood, he
had seen the dark robes and pale face of his
daughter Hela.</p>

<h3>III. HELA</h3>

<p class="dropcap">When it was known that Iduna had disappeared
from her grove, there were many sorrowful faces in
Asgard, and anxious voices were heard inquiring
for her. Loki walked about with as grave a face,
mid asked as many questions, as any one else; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he had a secret fear that became stronger every day,
that now, at last, the consequence of his evil ways
would find him out.</p>

<p>Days passed on, and the looks of care, instead
of wearing away, deepened on the faces of the
Æsir.</p>

<p>They met, and looked at each other, and turned
away sighing; each saw that some strange change
was creeping over all the others, and none liked to
be the first to speak of it. It came on very gradually—a
little change every day, and no day ever
passing without the change. The leaves of the trees
in Iduna’s grove deepened in color. They first became
a somber green, then a glowing red, and, at
last, a pale brown; and when the brisk winds came
and blew them about, they moved every day more
languidly.</p>

<p>“Let us alone,” they said at length. “We are
tired, tired, tired.”</p>

<p>The winds, surprised, carried the new sound to
Gladsheim, and whispered it all round the banquet-hall
where the Æsir sat, and then they rushed back
again, and blew all through the grove.</p>

<p>“We are tired,” said the leaves again; “we are
tired, we are old; we are going to die;” and at the
word they broke from the trees one by one, and fluttered
to the ground, glad to rest anywhere; and the
winds, having nothing else to do, went back to
Gladsheim with the last strange word they had
learned.</p>

<p>The Æsir were all assembled in Valhalla; but
there were no stories told, and no songs sung. No
one spoke much but Loki, and he was that day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a talking humor. He moved from one to another,
whispering an unwelcome word in every ear.</p>

<p>“Have you noticed your mother Frigga?” he said
to Baldur. “Do you see how white her hair is
growing, and what a number of deep lines are
printed on her face?”</p>

<p>Then he turned to Frey. “Look at your sister
Freya and your friend Baldur,” he said, “as they
sit opposite to us. What a change has come over
them lately! Who would think that that pale man
and that faded woman were Baldur the beautiful
and Freya the fair?”</p>

<p>“You are tired—you are old—you are going to
die,” moaned the winds, wandering all round the
great halls, and coming in and out of the hundred
doorways, and all the Æsir looked up at the sad
sound. Then they saw, for the first time, that a
new guest had seated herself that day at the table
of the Æsir. There could be no question of her
fitness on the score of royalty, for a crown rested
on her brow, and in her hand she held a scepter; but
the fingers that grasped the scepter were white and
fleshless, and under the crown looked the threatening
face of Hela, half corpse, half queen.</p>

<p>A great fear fell on all the Æsir as they looked,
and only Odin found voice to speak to her. “Dreadful
daughter of Loki!” he said, “by what warrant
do you dare to leave the kingdom where I permit
you to reign, and come to take your place
among the Æsir, who are no mates for such as
you?”</p>

<p>Then Hela raised her bony finger, and pointed,
one by one, to the guests that sat round. “White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hair,” she said, “wrinkled faces, weary limbs, dull
eyes—these are the warrants which have summoned
me from the land of shadows to sit among the Æsir.
I have come to claim you, by these signs, as my
future guests, and to tell you that I am preparing
a place for you in my kingdom.”</p>

<p>At every word she spoke a gust of icy wind came
from her mouth and froze the blood in the listeners’
veins. If she had stayed a moment longer they
would have stiffened into stone; but when she had
spoken thus, she rose and left the hall, and the sighing
winds went out with her.</p>

<p>Then, after a long silence, Bragi stood up and
spoke. “Æsir,” he said, “we are to blame. It is
now many months since Iduna was carried away
from us; we have mourned for her, but we have not
yet avenged her loss. Since she left us a strange
weariness and despair have come over us, and we
sit looking on each other as if we had ceased to be
warriors and Æsir. It is plain that, unless Iduna
returns, we are lost. Let two of us journey to the
Urda fount, which we have so long neglected to
visit, and enquire of her from the Norns—for they
know all things—and then, when we have learnt
where she is, we will fight for her liberty, if need
be, till we die; for that will be an end more fitting
for us than to sit here and wither away under the
breath of Hela.”</p>

<p>At these words of Bragi the Æsir felt a revival
of their old strength and courage. Odin approved
of Bragi’s proposal, and decreed that he and Baldur
should undertake the journey to the dwelling-place
of the Norns. That very evening they set forth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for Hela’s visit showed them that they had no time
to lose.</p>

<p>It was a weary time to the dwellers in Asgard
while they were absent. Two new citizens had
taken up their abode in the city, Age and Pain.
They walked the streets hand-in-hand, and there
was no use in shutting the doors against them; for
however closely the entrance was barred, the
dwellers in the houses felt them as they passed.</p>

<h3>IV. THROUGH FLOOD AND FIRE</h3>

<p class="dropcap">At length, Baldur and Bragi returned with the
answer of the Norns, couched in mystic words,
which Odin alone could understand. It revealed
Loki’s treacherous conduct to the Æsir, and declared
that Iduna could only be brought back by
Loki, who must go in search of her, clothed in
Freya’s garments of falcon feathers.</p>

<p>Loki was very unwilling to venture on such a
search; but Thor threatened him with instant death
if he refused to obey Odin’s commands, or failed
to bring back Iduna; and, for his own safety he
was obliged to allow Freya to fasten the falcon
wings to his shoulders, and set off towards Thiassi’s
castle in Jötunheim, where he well knew that Iduna
was imprisoned.</p>

<p>It was called a castle; but it was, in reality, a
hollow in a dark rock; the sea broke against two
sides of it; and, above, the sea-birds clamored day
and night.</p>

<p>There the giant had taken Iduna on the night on
which she had left her grove; and, fearing lest Odin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
should spy her from Air Throne, he had shut her up
in a gloomy chamber, and strictly forbidden her
ever to come out. It was hard to be shut up from
the fresh air and sunshine; and yet, perhaps, it was
safer for Iduna than if she had been allowed to
wander about Jötunheim and see the monstrous
sights that would have met her there.</p>

<p>She saw nothing but Thiassi himself and his servants,
whom he had commanded to attend upon her;
and they, being curious to see a stranger from a distant
land, came in and out many times every day.</p>

<p>They were fair, Iduna saw—fair and smiling;
and, at first, it relieved her to see such pleasant
faces round her, when she had expected something
horrible.</p>

<p>“Pity me!” she used to say to them; “pity me! I
have been torn away from my home and my husband,
and I see no hope of ever getting back.”
And she looked earnestly at them; but their pleasant
faces never changed, and there was always—however
bitterly Iduna might be weeping—the
same smile on their lips.</p>

<p>At length Iduna, looking more narrowly at them,
saw, when they turned their backs to her, that they
were hollow behind; they were, in truth, Ellewomen,
who have no hearts, and can never pity
any one.</p>

<p>After Iduna saw this she looked no more at their
smiling faces, but turned away her head and wept
silently. It is very sad to live among Ellewomen
when one is in trouble.</p>

<p>Every day the giant came and thundered at
Iduna’s door. “Have you made up your mind yet,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he used to say, “to give me the apples? Something
dreadful will happen to you if you take much
longer to think of it.” Iduna trembled very much
every day, but still she had strength to say, “No;”
for she knew that the <em>most</em> dreadful thing would be
for her to give to a wicked giant the gifts that had
been entrusted to her for the use of the Æsir. The
giant would have taken the apples by force if he
could; but, whenever he put his hand into the casket,
the fruit slipped from beneath his fingers,
shrivelled into the size of a pea, and hid itself in
crevices of the casket where his great fingers could
not come—only when Iduna’s little white hand
touched it, it swelled again to its own size, and this
she would never do while the giant was with her.
So the days passed on, and Iduna would have died
of grief among the smiling Ellewomen if it had not
been for the moaning sound of the sea and the wild
cry of the birds; “for, however others may smile,
these pity me,” she used to say, and it was like
music to her.</p>

<p>One morning when she knew that the giant had
gone out, and when the Ellewomen had left her
alone, she stood for a long time at her window by
the sea, watching the mermaids floating up and
down on the waves, and looking at heaven with
their sad blue eyes. She knew that they were
mourning because they had no souls, and she
thought within herself that even in prison it was
better to belong to the Æsir than to be a mermaid
or an Ellewoman, were they ever so free or happy.</p>

<p>While she was still occupied with these thoughts
she heard her name spoken, and a bird with large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wings flew in at the window, and, smoothing its
feathers, stood upright before her. It was Loki
in Freya’s garment of feathers, and he made her
understand in a moment that he had come to set
her free, and that there was no time to lose. He
told her to conceal her casket carefully in her
bosom, and then he said a few words over her, and
she found herself changed into a sparrow, with the
casket fastened among the feathers of her breast.</p>

<p>Then Loki spread his wings once more, and flew
out of the window, and Iduna followed him. The
sea-wind blew cold and rough, and her little wings
fluttered with fear; but she struck them bravely out
into the air and flew like an arrow over the water.</p>

<p>“This way lies Asgard,” cried Loki, and the word
gave her strength. But they had not gone far
when a sound was heard above the sea, and the
wind, and the call of the sea-birds. Thiassi had put
on his eagle plumage, and was flying after them.
For five days and five nights the three flew over the
water that divides Jötunheim from Asgard, and, at
the end of every day, they were closer together, for
the giant was gaining on the other two.</p>

<p>All the five days the dwellers in Asgard stood on
the walls of the city watching. On the sixth
evening they saw a falcon and a sparrow, closely
pursued by an eagle, flying towards Asgard.</p>

<p>“There will not be time,” said Bragi, who had
been calculating the speed at which they flew.
“The eagle will reach them before they can get into
the city.”</p>

<p>But Odin desired a fire to be lighted upon the
walls; and Thor and Tyr, with what strength remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to them, tore up the trees from the groves
and gardens, and made a rampart of fire all round
the city. The light of the fire showed Iduna, her
husband and her friends waiting for her. She
made one last effort, and, rising high up in the air
above the flames and smoke, she passed the walls,
and dropped down safely at the foot of Odin’s
throne. The giant tried to follow; but, wearied
with his long flight, he was unable to raise his enormous
bulk sufficiently high in the air. The flames
scorched his wings as he flew through them, and he
fell among the flaming piles of wood and was burnt
to death.</p>

<p>How Iduna feasted the Æsir on her apples, how
they grew young and beautiful again, and how
spring, and green leaves, and music came back to
the grove, I must leave you to imagine, for I have
made my story long enough already; and if I say
any more you will fancy that it is Bragi who has
come among you, and that he has entered on his
endless story.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_THE_FENRIS_WOLF_WAS_CHAINED">HOW THE FENRIS WOLF WAS CHAINED</h2>

<p class="author">By E. M. Wilmot-Buxton</p>

<p class="dropcap">Fair as were the meads of Asgard, we have
seen that the Asa folk were fond of wandering
far afield in other regions. Most restless of
all was Red Loki, that cunning fellow who was
always bringing trouble upon himself or upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
kindred. And because he loved evil, he would
often betake himself to the gloomy halls of
Giantland and mingle with the wicked folk of
that region.</p>

<p>Now one day he met a hideous giantess named
Angur-Boda. This creature had a heart of ice,
and because he loved ugliness and evil she had a
great attraction for him, and in the end he married
her, and they lived together in a horrible cave in
Giantland.</p>

<p>Three children were born to Loki and Angur-Boda
in this dread abode, and they were even more
terrible in appearance than their mother. The
first was an immense wolf called Fenris, with a
huge mouth filled with long white teeth, which he
was constantly gnashing together.</p>

<p>The second was a wicked-looking serpent with a
fiery-red tongue lolling from its mouth.</p>

<p>The third was a hideous giantess, partly blue and
partly flesh-color, whose name was Hela.</p>

<p>No sooner were these three terrible children born
than all the wise men of the earth began to foretell
the misery they would bring upon the Asa folk.</p>

<p>In vain did Loki try to keep them hidden within
the cave wherein their mother dwelt. They soon
grew so immense in size that no dwelling would
contain them, and all the world began to talk of
their frightful appearance.</p>

<p>It was not long, of course, before All-Father
Odin, from his high seat in Asgard, heard of the
children of Loki. So he sent for some of the Asas,
and said:</p>

<p>“Much evil will come upon us, O my children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from this giant brood, if we defend not ourselves
against them. For their mother will teach them
wickedness, and still more quickly will they learn
the cunning wiles of their father. Fetch me them
here, therefore, that I may deal with them forthwith.”</p>

<p>So, after somewhat of a struggle, the Asas captured
the three giant-children and brought them
before Odin’s judgment-seat.</p>

<p>Then Odin looked first at Hela, and when he
saw her gloomy eyes, full of misery and despair,
he was sorry and dealt kindly with her, saying:
“Thou art the bringer of Pain to man, and Asgard
is no place for such as thou. But I will make thee
ruler of the Mist Home, and there shalt thou rule
over that unlighted world, the Region of the
Dead.”</p>

<p>Forthwith he sent her away over rough roads to
the cold, dark region of the North called the Mist
Home. And there did Hela rule over a grim crew,
for all those who had done wickedness in the world
above were imprisoned by her in those gloomy
regions. To her came also all those who had died,
not on the battlefield, but of old age or disease.
And though these were treated kindly enough,
theirs was a joyless life in comparison with that of
the dead warriors who were feasting and fighting
in the halls of Valhalla, under the kindly rule of
All-Father Odin.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of Hela, Odin next turned
his attention to the serpent. And when he saw his
evil tongue and cunning, wicked eyes, he said:</p>

<p>“Thou art he who bringest Sin into the world of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
men; therefore the ocean shall be thy home for
ever.”</p>

<p>Then he threw that horrid serpent into the deep
sea which surrounds all lands, and there the creature
grew so fast that when he stretched himself
one day he encircled all the earth, and held his own
tail fast in his mouth. And sometimes he grew
angry to think that he, the son of a god, had thus
been cast out; and at those times he would writhe
with his huge body and lash his tail till the sea
spouted up to the sky. And when that happened
the men of the North said that a great tempest
was raging. But it was only the Serpent-son of
Loki writhing in his wrath.</p>

<p>Then Odin turned to the third child. And behold!
the Fenris Wolf was so appalling to look
upon that Odin feared to cast him forth, and he
decided to endeavor to tame him by kindness so that
he should not wish them ill.</p>

<p>But when he bade them carry food to the Fenris
Wolf, not one of the Asas would do so, for they
feared a snap from his great jaws. Only the brave
Tyr had courage enough to feed him, and the wolf
ate so much and so fast that the business took him
all his time. Meantime, too, the Fenris grew so
rapidly, and became so fierce, that the gods were
compelled to take counsel and consider how they
should get rid of him. They remembered that it
would make their peaceful halls unholy if they were
to slay him, and so they resolved instead to bind
him fast, that he should be unable to do them harm.</p>

<p>So those of the Asa folk who were clever smiths
set to work and made a very strong, thick chain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and when it was finished they carried it out to the
yard where the wolf dwelt, and said to him, as
though in jest:</p>

<p>“Here is a fine proof of thy boasted strength, O
Fenris. Let us bind this about thee, that we may
see if thou canst break it asunder.”</p>

<p>Then the wolf gave a great grin with his wide
jaws, and came and stood still that they might bind
the chain about him; for he knew what he could
do. And it came to pass that directly they had
fastened the chain, and had slipped aside from him,
the great beast gave himself a shake, and the chain
fell about him in little bits.</p>

<p>At this the Asas were much annoyed, but they
tried not to show it, and praised him for his
strength.</p>

<p>Then they set to work again upon a chain much
stronger than the last, and brought it to the Fenris
Wolf, saying:</p>

<p>“Great will be thy renown, O Fenris, if thou
canst break this chain as thou didst the last.”</p>

<p>But the wolf looked at them askance, for the
chain they brought was very much thicker than
the one he had already broken. He reflected, however,
that since that time he himself had grown
stronger and bigger, and moreover, that one must
risk something in order to win renown.</p>

<p>So he let them put the chain upon him, and
when the Asas said that all was ready, he gave a
good shake and stretched himself a few times, and
again the fetters lay in fragments on the ground.</p>

<p>Then the gods began to fear that they would
never hold the wolf in bonds; and it was All-Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Odin who persuaded them to make one more attempt.</p>

<p>So they sent a messenger to Dwarfland bidding
him ask the Little Men to make a chain which
nothing could possibly destroy.</p>

<p>Setting at once to work, the clever little smiths
soon fashioned a slender silken rope, and gave it
to the messenger, saying that no strength could
break it, and that the more it was strained the
stronger it would become.</p>

<p>It was made of the most mysterious things—the
sound of a cat’s footsteps, the roots of a mountain,
the sinews of a bear, the breath of fishes, and other
such strange materials, which only the dwarfs knew
how to use.</p>

<p>With this chain the messenger hastened back
over the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard.</p>

<p>By this time the Fenris Wolf had grown too
big for his yard, so he lived on a rocky island
in the middle of the lake that lies in the midst of
Asgard.</p>

<p>And here the Asas now betook themselves with
their chain, and began to play their part with wily
words.</p>

<p>“See,” they cried, “O Fenris! Here is a cord
so soft and thin that none would think of it binding
such strength as thine.”</p>

<p>And they laughed great laughs, and handed it to
one another, and tried its strength by pulling at it
with all their might, but it did not break.</p>

<p>Then they came nearer and used more wiles,
saying:</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> cannot break the cord, though ’tis stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
than it looks, but thou, O mighty one, will be able
to snap it in a moment.”</p>

<p>But the wolf tossed his head in scorn, and said:</p>

<p>“Small renown would there be to me, O Asa
folk, if I were to break yon slender string. Save,
therefore, your breath, and leave me now alone.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” cried the Asas. “Thou fearest the might
of the silken cord, thou false one, and that is why
thou wilt not let us bind thee!”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said the Fenris Wolf, growing rather
suspicious, “but if it is made with craft and guile
it shall never come near my feet.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Asas, “thou wilt surely be able
to break this silken cord with ease, since thou hast
already broken the great iron fetters.”</p>

<p>To this the wolf made no answer, pretending not
to hear.</p>

<p>“Come!” said the Asas again, “why shouldst
thou fear? For even if thou couldst not break the
cord we would immediately let thee free again.
To refuse is a coward’s piece of work.”</p>

<p>Then the wolf gnashed his teeth at them in
anger, and said:</p>

<p>“Well I know you Asas! For if you bind me
so fast that I cannot get loose you will skulk away,
and it will be long before I get any help from you;
and therefore am I loath to let this band be laid
upon me.”</p>

<p>But still the Asas continued to persuade him
and to twit him with cowardice, until at length the
Fenris Wolf said, with a sullen growl:</p>

<p>“Have it your own way then. But, as a pledge
that this is done without deceit, let one of you lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
his hand in my mouth while you are binding me,
and afterwards while I try to break the bonds.”</p>

<p>Then the Asa folk looked at one another in
dismay, for they knew very well what this would
mean.</p>

<p>And while they consulted together the wolf
stood gnashing his teeth at them with a horrid grin.</p>

<p>At length Tyr the Brave hesitated no longer.
Boldly he stalked up to the wolf and thrust his arm
into his enormous mouth, bidding the Asas bind
fast the beast. Scarce had they done so when the
wolf began to strain and pull, but the more he did
so the tighter and stiffer the rope became.</p>

<p>The gods shouted and laughed with glee when
they saw how all his efforts were in vain. But Tyr
did not join in their mirth, for the wolf in his rage
snapped his great teeth together and bit off his
hand at the wrist.</p>

<p>Now when the Asas discovered that the animal
was fast bound, they took the chain which was
fixed to the rope and drew it through a huge rock,
and fastened this rock deep down in the earth, so
that it could never be moved. And this they
fastened to another great rock which was driven
still deeper into the ground.</p>

<p>When the Fenris Wolf found that he had been
thus secured he opened his mouth terribly wide,
and twisted himself right and left, and tried his
best to bite the Asa folk. He uttered, moreover,
such terrible howls that at length the gods could
bear it no longer. So they took a sword and thrust
it into his mouth, so that the hilt rested on his
lower, and the point against his upper, jaw. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
there he was doomed to remain until the End of
All Things shall come, when he</p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_BALDER_THE">THE STORY OF BALDER THE
BEAUTIFUL</h2>

<p class="author">By E. M. Wilmot-Buxton</p>

<p class="dropcap">Fair beyond all the sons of Odin was Balder
the Beautiful, Balder of the snow-white brow
and golden locks, and he was well beloved not
only by the Asa folk, but also by the men of the
earth below.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Of all the twelve round Odin’s throne,</div>
<div class="verse">Balder the Beautiful, alone,</div>
<div class="verse">The Sun god, good and pure and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Was loved by all, as all love light.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Balder had a twin-brother named Hoder, who
was born blind. Gloomy and silent was he, but
none the less he loved his bright sun-brother best
of all in heaven or earth.</p>

<p>The home of Balder was a place with silver roof
and pillars of gold, and nothing unclean or impure
was allowed to come inside its doors.</p>

<p>Very wise in all magic charms was this radiant
young god; and for all others save himself he could
read the future; but “to keep his own life safe and
see the sun” was not granted to him.</p>

<p>Now there came a time when Balder’s bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
face grew sad and downcast; and when his father
Odin and his mother Frigga perceived this they
implored him to tell them the cause of his grief.
Then Balder told them that he had been troubled
by strange dreams; and, since in those days men
believed that dreams were sent as a warning of
what was about to happen, he had gone heavily
since these visions had come to him.</p>

<p>First he had dreamt that a dark cloud had arisen
which came before the sun and shut out all brightness
from the land.</p>

<p>The next night he dreamt again that Asgard lay
in darkness, and that her bright flowers and
radiant trees were withered and lifeless, and that
the Asa folk, dull and withered also, were sorrowing
as though from some great calamity.</p>

<p>The third night he dreamt yet again that Asgard
was dark and lifeless and that from out of the
gloom one sad voice cried:</p>

<p>“Woe! Woe! Woe! For Balder the Beautiful
is dead—is dead!”</p>

<p>Odin listened to the recital of this story with
heavy heart, and at its conclusion he mounted his
coal-black horse and rode over many a hard and
toilsome road till he came to the dark abode of
Hela. And there he saw to his surprise, that a
great banquet was being prepared in the gloomy
hall. Dishes of gold were set upon the table and
all the couches were covered with the richest silken
tapestry, as though some honored guest were expected.
But a throne that stood at the head of the
table was empty.</p>

<p>Very thoughtfully Odin rode on through those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
dim halls till he came to one where dwelt an ancient
prophetess, whose voice no man had heard for
many a long year.</p>

<p>Silent he stood before her, until she asked in a
voice that sounded as though it came from far
away: “Who art thou, and from whence dost thou
come to trouble my long rest?”</p>

<p>Now Odin was fearful that she would not answer
him did he give his real name, so he told her that he
was the son of Valtam, and asked anxiously for
whom the grim goddess of Death was preparing
her banquet.</p>

<p>Then, to his great grief, the hollow voice of the
prophetess replied that Balder was the expected
guest, and that he would shortly be sent thither,
slain by the hand of Hoder, the blind god of Darkness.</p>

<p>“Who then,” asked Odin, in sorrowful tones,
“shall avenge the death of Balder?”</p>

<p>And she answered that the son of the Earth-goddess,
Vali by name, should neither</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“Comb his raven hair</div>
<div class="verse">Nor wash his visage in the stream,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor see the sun’s departing beam,</div>
<div class="verse">Till he on Hoder’s corse shall smile</div>
<div class="verse">Flaming on the funeral pile.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And learning thus of the fate of his two favorite
sons, All-Father Odin went sadly back to
Asgard.</p>

<p>Meantime Mother Frigga had not been idle.
Filled with anxiety for her darling son, she decided
to send her servants throughout the earth, bidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
them exact a promise from all things—not only
living creatures, but plants, stones, and metals,
fire, water, trees and diseases of all kinds—that
they would do harm in no way to Balder the
Beautiful.</p>

<p>Theirs was an easy task, for all things loved
the bright Sun-god, and readily agreed to give the
pledge. Nothing was overlooked save only the
mistletoe, growing upon the oak-tree that shaded
the entrance to Valhalla. It seemed so insignificant
that no one thought it worth while to ask this plant
to take the oath.</p>

<p>The servants returned to Frigga with all the
vows and compacts that had been made; and the
Mother of Gods and Men went back with heart at
ease to her spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>The Asa folk, too, were reassured, and, casting
aside the burden of care that had fallen upon
them, they resumed their favorite game upon
the plains of Idavold, where they were wont to
contend with one another in the throwing of
golden disks.</p>

<p>And when it became known among them that
nothing would hurt Balder the Beautiful they invented
a new game.</p>

<p>Placing the young Sun-god in their midst, they
would throw stones at him, or thrust at him
with their knives, or strike with their wooden
staves; and the wood or the knife or the stone
would glance off from Balder and leave him
quite unhurt.</p>

<p>This new game delighted both Balder and the
Asa folk, and so loud was their laughter that Loki,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
who was some distance away pursuing one of his
schemes in the disguise of an old woman, shook
with rage at the sound. For Loki was jealous of
Balder and, as is usual with people who make themselves
disliked, nothing gave him such displeasure
as to see a group of the Asas on such happy terms
with each other.</p>

<p>Presently, in his wanderings, Loki passed by the
house of Fensalir, in the doorway of which sat
Frigga, at her spinning-wheel. She did not recognize
Red Loki, but greeted him kindly and
asked:</p>

<p>“Old woman, dost thou know why the gods are
so merry this evening?”</p>

<p>And Loki answered: “They are casting stones
and throwing sharp knives and great clubs at
Balder the Beautiful, who stands smiling in their
midst, daring them to hurt him.”</p>

<p>Then Frigga smiled tranquilly and turned again
to her wheel, saying:</p>

<p>“Let them play on, for no harm will come to him
whom all things in heaven and earth have sworn
not to hurt.”</p>

<p>“Art thou sure, good mother, that <em>all</em> things in
heaven and earth have taken this vow?”</p>

<p>“Ay, indeed,” replied Frigga, “all save a harmless
little plant, the mistletoe, which grows on the
oak by Valhalla, and this is far too small and weak
to be feared.”</p>

<p>And to this Loki replied in musing voice, nodding
his head as he spoke: “Yea, thou art right,
great Mother of Gods and Men.”</p>

<p>But the wicked Asa had learnt what he desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to know. The instrument by which he might bring
harm to Balder the Beautiful was now awaiting
him, and he determined to use it, to the dire sorrow
of Asgard.</p>

<p>Hastening to the western gate of Valhalla, he
pulled a clump of the mistletoe from the oak, and
fashioned therefrom a little wand, or stick, and
with this in his hand he returned to the plain of
Idavold. He was far too cunning, however, to
attempt to carry out his wicked design himself.
His malicious heart was too well known to the Asa
folk. But he soon found an innocent tool. Leaning
against a tree, and taking no part in the game,
was Hoder, the blind god, the twin brother of
Balder, and to him he began:</p>

<p>“Hark to the Asas—how they laugh! Do you
take no share in the game, good Hoder?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Hoder gloomily, “for I am blind,
and know not where to throw.”</p>

<p>“I could show you that,” said Loki, assuming
a pleasant tone; “’tis no hard matter, Hoder, and
methinks the Asas will call you proud and haughty
if you take no share in the fun.”</p>

<p>“But I have nothing to throw,” said poor blind
Hoder.</p>

<p>Then Loki said: “Here, at least, is a small shaft,
’twill serve your purpose,” and leading innocent
Hoder into the ring he cunningly guided his aim.
Hoder, well pleased to be able to share in a game
with his beloved brother, boldly sped the shaft, expecting
to hear the usual shout of joyous laughter
which greeted all such attempts. There fell instead
dead silence on his ear, and immediately on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
this followed a wail of bitter agony. For Balder
the Beautiful had fallen dead without a groan, his
heart transfixed by the little dart of mistletoe.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round</div>
<div class="verse">Lay thickly strewn swords, axes, darts, and spears,</div>
<div class="verse">Which all the Gods in sport had idly thrown</div>
<div class="verse">At Balder, whom no weapon pierced or clove;</div>
<div class="verse">But in his breast stood fixed the fatal bough</div>
<div class="verse">Of mistletoe, which Loki the Accuser gave</div>
<div class="verse">To Hoder, and unwitting Hoder threw—</div>
<div class="verse">’Gainst that alone had Balder’s life no charm.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dreading he knew not what, Hoder stood in
doubt for some moments. But soon the meaning
of that bitter wail was borne in upon him, piercing
the cloud of darkness in which he always moved.
He opened wide his arms as though to clasp the
beloved form, and then with: “I have slain thee,
my brother,” despair seized him and he fell prostrate
in utter grief.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Asa folk crowded round the silent
form of Balder, weeping and wailing; but, alas!
their moans and tears could not bring Balder back.
At length, All-Father Odin, whose grief was too
deep for lamentations, bade them be silent and
prepare to bear the body of the dead Asa to the
seashore.</p>

<p>The unhappy Hoder, unable to take part in these
last offices, made his way sadly through Asgard,
beyond the walls and along the seashore, until he
came to the house Fensalir.</p>

<p>Frigga was seated upon her seat of honor before
the fire against the inner wall, and standing before
her, with bent head and woeful, sightless gaze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Hoder told her of the dread mishap that had
befallen.</p>

<p>“Tell me, O mother,” he cried in ending, and his
voice sounded like the wail of the wind on stormy
nights, “Tell me, is there aught I can do to bring my
brother back? Or can I make agreement with the
dread mother of the Underworld, giving my life in
exchange for his?”</p>

<p>Woe crowded upon woe in the heart of Frigga
as she listened to the story. The doom was wrought
that she had tried so vainly to avert, and not even
her mother’s love had availed to safeguard the son
so dearly cherished.</p>

<p>“On Balder Death hath laid her hand, not thee,
my son,” she said, “yet though we fail in the end,
there is much that may be tried before all hope is
lost.”</p>

<p>Then she told Hoder of a road by which the
abode of Hela could be reached, one which had been
travelled by none living save Odin himself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Who goes that way must take no other horse</div>
<div class="verse">To ride, but Sleipnir, Odin’s horse, alone.</div>
<div class="verse">Nor must he choose that common path of gods</div>
<div class="verse">Which every day they come and go in heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But he must tread a dark untravelled road</div>
<div class="verse">Which branches from the north of heaven, and ride</div>
<div class="verse">Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,</div>
<div class="verse">Through valleys deep engulfed, with roaring streams.</div>
<div class="verse">And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge</div>
<div class="verse">Which spans with golden arches Giöll’s stream.</div>
<div class="verse">Then he will journey through no lighted land,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor see the sun arise, nor see it set;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And he must fare across the dismal ice</div>
<div class="verse">Northward, until he meets a stretching wall</div>
<div class="verse">Barring his way, and in the wall a grate,</div>
<div class="verse">But then he must dismount and on the ice,</div>
<div class="verse">Tighten the girths of Sleipnir, Odin’s horse,</div>
<div class="verse">And make him leap the grate, and come within.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There in that cheerless abode dead Balder was
enthroned, but, said Frigga, he who braves that
dread journey must take no heed of him, nor of the
sad ghosts flitting to and fro, like eddying leaves.
First he must accost their gloomy queen and entreat
her with prayers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Telling her all that grief they have in heaven</div>
<div class="verse">For Balder, whom she holds by right below.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A bitter groan of anguish escaped from Hoder
when Frigga had finished her recital of the trials
which must be undergone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Mother, a dreadful way is this thou showest;</div>
<div class="verse">No journey for a sightless god to go.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And she replied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“… Thyself thou shalt not go, my son;</div>
<div class="verse">But he whom first thou meetest when thou com’st</div>
<div class="verse">To Asgard and declar’st this hidden way,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall go; and I will be his guide unseen.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meantime the Asa folk had felled trees and had
carried to the seashore outside the walls of Asgard
a great pile of fuel, which they laid upon the deck
of Balder’s great ship, <i>Ringhorn</i>, as it lay stranded
high upon the beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Seventy ells and four extended</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On the grass the vessel’s keel;</div>
<div class="verse">High above it, gilt and splendid,</div>
<div class="verse">Rose the figurehead ferocious</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With its crest of steel.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they adorned the funeral pyre with garlands
of flowers, with golden vessels and rings, with
finely wrought weapons and rich necklets and armlets;
and when this was done they carried out the
fair body of Balder the Beautiful, and bearing it
reverently upon their shields they laid it upon the
pyre.</p>

<p>Then they tried to launch the good ship, but so
heavily laden was she that they could not stir her
an inch.</p>

<p>The Mountain-Giants, from their heights afar,
had watched the tragedy with eyes that were not
unpitying, for even they had no ill-will for Balder
and they sent and told of a giantess called Hyrroken,
who was so strong that she could launch any
vessel whatever its weight might be.</p>

<p>So the Asas sent to fetch her from Giantland,
and she soon came, riding a wolf for steed and
twisted serpents for reins.</p>

<p>When she alighted, Odin ordered four of his
mightiest warriors to hold the wolf, but he was
so strong that they could do nothing until the
giantess had thrown him down and bound him
fast.</p>

<p>Then with a few enormous strides, Hyrroken
reached the great vessel, and set her shoulder
against the prow, sending the ship rolling into the
deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The earth shook with the force of the movement
as though with an earthquake, and the Asa
folk collided with one another like pine-trees during
a storm. The ship, too, with its precious weight,
was well-nigh lost. At this Thor was wroth and,
seizing his hammer, would have slain the giantess
had not the other Asas held him back, bidding him
not forget the last duty to the dead god. So Thor
hallowed the pyre with a touch of his sacred hammer
and kindled it with a thorn twig, which is the
emblem of sleep.</p>

<p>Last of all, before the pyre blazed up, All-Father
Odin added to the pile of offerings his magic ring,
from which fell eight new rings every ninth night,
and bending he whispered in Balder’s ear.</p>

<p>But none to this day know the words that Odin
spake thus in the ear of his dead son.</p>

<p>Then the flames from the pyre rose high and
the great ship drifted out to sea, and the wind
caught the sails and fanned the flames till it
seemed as though sky and sea were wrapped in
golden flame.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And while they gazed, the sun went lurid down</div>
<div class="verse">Into the smoke-wrapt sea, and night came on.</div>

<div class="verse">So, with a shower of sparks, the pile fell in,</div>
<div class="verse">Reddening the sea around; and all was dark.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And thus did Balder the Beautiful pass from the
peaceful steads of Asgard, as passes the sun when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he paints the evening clouds with the glory of his
setting.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WONDERFUL_QUERN_STONES">THE WONDERFUL QUERN STONES</h2>

<p class="author">By Julia Goddard</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time there was a king of Denmark,
or Gotland, as it was then called,
whose name was Frothi. He was a great-grandson
of the god Thor, and a very mighty king, and
wherever the Danish language was spoken there
was Frothi’s name honored and respected.</p>

<p>Among his treasures were two quern stones;
nothing much to look at, simply two common millstones
in appearance, and no one who did not know
what they could do would think of taking any
notice of them. Nevertheless these quern stones
were of more worth than anything that King
Frothi had, for they could produce anything that
the grinder of the quern or hand-mill wished for.
They would bring gold, silver, precious stones,
anything and everything; and besides this they
could grind love, joy, peace; therefore it is not too
much to say that these stones were worth more than
all the treasures of the king put together.</p>

<p>At least they would have been if he could have
made use of them, but they were so heavy that few
could be found to turn the quern, and just at the
time of which I am speaking there was no one at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
all in the land of Gotland able to work away at the
quern handle.</p>

<p>Now the more King Frothi pondered over his
wonderful quern stones, the greater became his
desire to use them, and he sought throughout the
land from north to south, from east to west, if perchance
he might find someone strong enough to help
him in his need. But all to no purpose, and he was
utterly in despair when, by good luck he happened
to go on a visit to Fiölnir, King of Sweden, and to
hear of two slave-women of great size and strength.
Surely, thought Frothi, these are just the women
to grind at my quern Grotti (for so it was called),
and he asked King Fiölnir to be allowed to see them.</p>

<p>So King Fiölnir ordered the slaves to be brought
before Frothi, and when Frothi saw them his
spirits rose, for certainly Menia and Fenia were
strong-looking women. They were eight feet in
height, and broader across the shoulders than any
of Frothi’s warriors, and the muscles of their arms
stood out like cords. And they lifted heavy
weights, threw heavy javelins, and did so many
feats of strength that Frothi felt quite sure that
they would be able to turn the quern handle.</p>

<p>“I will buy these slaves,” said he, “and take them
with me to Gotland.”</p>

<p>Menia and Fenia stood with their arms folded
and their proud heads bowed down, while Frothi
counted out the gold to the seller. They were
slaves; with money had they been bought, with
money were they sold again. What cared Frothi
who was their father, or how they had come into the
land of Sweden?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>And he took them home with him and bade them
grind at the quern. Now he should be able to test
the power of the wonderful stones.</p>

<p>“Grind, grind, Menia and Fenia, let me see
whether you have strength for the work.”</p>

<p>So spake the King Frothi, and the huge women
lifted the heavy stones as though they had been
pebbles.</p>

<p>“What shall we grind?” asked the slaves.</p>

<p>“Gold, gold, peace and wealth for Frothi.”</p>

<p>Gold! gold! the land was filled with riches.
Treasure in the king’s palace, treasure in the coffers
of his subjects—gold! gold! There were no poor
in the land, no beggars in the streets, no children
crying for bread. All honor to the quern stones!</p>

<p>Peace! peace! no more war in the land. Frothi
is at peace with everyone. And more than that,
there was peace in all countries where Frothi’s
name was known, even to the far south; and everyone
talked of Frothi’s peace. Praise be to the quern
stones! Wealth! yes, everything went well. Not
one of the counsels of King Frothi failed. There
was not a green field that did not yield a rich crop;
not a tree but bent beneath its weight of fruit; not
a stream that ran dry; not a vessel that sailed
from the harbors of Gotland that came not back,
after a fair voyage, in safety to its haven. There
was good luck everywhere.</p>

<p>“Grind on, grind on, Menia and Fenia! good
fortune is mine,” said King Frothi.</p>

<p>And the slaves ground on.</p>

<p>“When shall we rest, when may we rest, King
Frothi? It is weary work toiling day and night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“No longer than whilst the cuckoo is silent in the
spring.”</p>

<p>“Never ceasing is the cry of the cuckoo in the
groves; may we not rest longer?”</p>

<p>“Not longer,” answered King Frothi, “than
whilst the verse of a song is sung.”</p>

<p>“That is but little!” sighed Menia and Fenia,
and they toiled on. Their arms were weary and
their eyes heavy; they would fain have slept, but
Frothi would not let them have any sleep. They
were but slaves who must obey their master, so they
toiled on, still grinding peace and wealth to Frothi:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To Frothi and his queen</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Joy and peace—</div>
<div class="verse">May plenty in the land</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Still increase.</div>
<div class="verse">Frothi and his queen</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From dangers keep;</div>
<div class="verse">May they on beds of down</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sweetly sleep.</div>

<div class="verse indent1">The high or low—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To none be woe,</div>
<div class="verse">Good luck to all,</div>
<div class="verse">Good luck to all.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We grind, we grind,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">No rest we find,</div>
<div class="verse">For rest we call.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus sang the two giant women; then they
begged again: “Give us rest, O Frothi!”</p>

<p>But still Frothi answered: “Rest whilst the verse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of a song is sung, or as long as the cuckoo is silent
in the spring.”</p>

<p>No longer would the king give them.</p>

<p>Yet Frothi was deemed a good king, but gold
and good luck were hardening his heart.</p>

<p>Menia and Fenia went on grinding, and their
wrath grew deeper and deeper, and thus at last
they spoke.</p>

<p>First said Fenia: “Thou wert not wise, O Frothi.
Thou didst buy us because like giants we towered
above the other slaves, because we were strong and
hardy and could lift heavy burdens.”</p>

<p>And Menia took up the wail: “Are we not of the
race of the mountain giants? Are not our kindred
greater than thine, O Frothi? The quern had
never left the gray fell but for the giants’ daughters.
Never, never should we have ground as we
have done had it not been that we remembered
from what race we sprang.”</p>

<p>Then answered Menia: “Nine long winters saw
us training to feats of strength, nine long winters
of wearisome labor. Deep down in the earth we
toiled and toiled until we could move the high
mountain from its foundations. We are weird
women, O Frothi. We can see far into the future.
Our eyes have looked upon the quern before. In
the giants’ house we whirled it until the earth shook,
and hoarse thunder resounded through the caverns.
Thou art not wise, O Frothi! O Frothi; thou art
not wise!”</p>

<p>But Frothi heard them not; he was sleeping the
sweet sleep that the quern stones had ground for
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Strong are we indeed,” laughed Fenia sorrowfully,
“strong to contend with the puny men—we
whose pastime in Sweden was to tame the fiercest
bears, so that they ate from our hands; we who
fought with mighty warriors and came off conquerors;
we who helped one prince and put down another.
Well we fought, and many were the wounds
we received from sharp spears and flashing swords.
Frothi knows not our power or he would scarce have
brought us to his palace to treat us thus. Here
no one has compassion upon us. Cold are the skies
above us, and the pitiless wind beats on our breasts.
Cold is the ground on which we stand, and the keen
frost bites our feet. Ah, there are none to pity us.
No one cares for the slaves. We grind forever an
enemy’s quern, and he gives us no rest. Grind,
grind; I am weary of grinding; I must have rest.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” returned Menia, “talk not of rest until
Frothi is content with what we bring him.”</p>

<p>Then Fenia started: “If he gives us no rest, let
us take it ourselves. Why should we any longer
grind good for him who only gives us evil? We can
grind what we please. Let us revenge ourselves.”</p>

<p>Then Menia turned the handle quicker than ever,
and in a wild voice she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I see a ship comes sailing</div>
<div class="verse">With warriors bold aboard,</div>
<div class="verse">There’s many a one that in Danish blood</div>
<div class="verse">Would be glad to dip his sword.</div>
<div class="verse">Say, shall we grind them hither?</div>
<div class="verse">Say, shall they land to-night?</div>
<div class="verse">Say, shall they set the palace afire?</div>
<div class="verse">Say, shall they win the fight?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then called Fenia in a voice of thunder through
the midnight air: “Frothi, Frothi, awake, awake!
Wilt thou not listen to us? Have mercy and let
us rest our weary limbs.” But all was still, and
Frothi gave no answer to the cry.</p>

<p>“Nay,” answered Menia, “he will not hearken.
Little he cares for the worn-out slaves. Revenge,
revenge!”</p>

<p>And Frothi slept, not dreaming of the evil that
was coming upon him.</p>

<p>And again Fenia shouted: “Frothi, Frothi,
awake! The beacon is blazing. Danger is nigh.
Wilt thou not spare?”</p>

<p>But Frothi gave no answer, and the giant women
toiled on.</p>

<p>“O Frothi, Frothi, we cannot bear our weariness.”
And still no answer came.</p>

<p>“Frothi, Frothi, danger is nigh thee. Well-manned
ships are gliding over the sea. It is
Mysingr who comes; his white sail flutters in the
wind; his flag is unfurled. Frothi, Frothi, awake,
awake; thou shalt be king no longer.”</p>

<p>And as the giant women ground, the words they
spake came to pass—they were grinding revenge
for themselves and brought the enemy nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>“Ho! hearken to the herald! Frothi, Frothi, the
town is on fire. The palaces will soon be ruined
heaps. Grind, Menia, ever more swiftly, until we
grind death to Frothi.”</p>

<p>And Menia and Fenia ground and ground till
Mysingr and his followers landed from the ships.
They ground until they had reached the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“To arms, to arms!” shouted the warder, but it
was too late. The Gotlanders armed themselves;
but who could stand against the army that the slave
women were grinding against them?</p>

<p>Not long did the struggle last. Frothi and his
Gotlanders fought bravely, but the sea-king and
his allies were mightier, for the giantesses were
in giant mood, and turned the handle faster and
faster, until down fell the quern stones. Then sank
Frothi pierced with wounds, and the fight was
over. The army that Menia and Fenia had ground
to help Mysingr vanished; and Mysingr and his
men alone were left conquerors on the bloody field.</p>

<p>They loaded their ships with treasure, and Mysingr
took with him Menia, Fenia, and the quern
stones.</p>

<p>But, alas! Mysingr was no wiser than King
Frothi had been.</p>

<p>Gold, however, was not his first thought; he had
enough of that, but he wanted something else that
just then was more to him than gold.</p>

<p>There was no salt on board the sea-king’s vessels;
so he said: “Grind salt.”</p>

<p>And Menia and Fenia ground salt for Mysingr.</p>

<p>At midnight they asked if they had ground
enough.</p>

<p>And Mysingr bade them grind on.</p>

<p>And so they ground and ground until the ship
was so heavy with salt that it sank, and the sea-king
and all his men were drowned.</p>

<p>Where the quern stones went down there is to
this day a great whirlpool, and the waters of the
sea have been salt ever since.</p>

<h2 id="BRUNHILDA_AND_THE_MAGIC_SWORD">BRUNHILDA AND THE MAGIC SWORD</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">On the summit of a rocky mountain peak a
beautiful maiden lay sleeping. On every
side rose the tall dark pine trees, like huge giants
on guard. A circle of magic fire formed a glowing
wall around her rocky couch.</p>

<p>The sun rose and set, night succeeded day, winter
and summer came and went, but the maiden
slept on still.</p>

<p>From head to foot she was encased in shining
armor. On her breast lay a shield, on her head
glistened a warrior’s helmet, and at her side a
spear. For on a day long past it had been decreed
that thus this maiden should sleep, till awakened
by the kiss of one who would dare the flames for
her sake, and claim her as bride.</p>

<p>Many a knight, hearing of the beautiful sleeper,
had thought to win his way to her; but no sooner
did he see the angry fire darting out on all sides,
and feel the scorching heat of the great flames,
than the bravest fell back discouraged.</p>

<p>Time was when this fair warrior had dwelt with
the gods and goddesses in Valhalla, for she was
none other than Brunhilda, favorite daughter of
Wotan the king. She had eight sisters, each one
beautiful as the dawn, and knowing neither fear
nor weakness; but among them all Brunhilda was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fairest, bravest, and strongest. These nine maidens
were known as the Valkyrie, and each was a warrior
perfect in the art of war. Chief among their
duties was to attend all battles on earth. Riding
on their winged horses, they would hover over the
battlefield, and, when a hero fell, swoop down and
bear his lifeless body to Valhalla, where he would
awaken to live among the gods, and be from henceforth
one of the chosen bodyguard of Wotan.</p>

<p>Now it happened on a day in these times long
past that Wotan called to him Brunhilda, and
charged her that she should defend Siegmund the
Volsung in a deadly combat he was about to engage
in with the grim and savage Hunding.</p>

<p>Wotan had reasons for wishing to grant Siegmund
a special favor. The Father of the Gods had
once struck a mighty sword into the heart of an
ancient ash tree, decreeing that it should belong to
him alone who could pluck it out. Many a valiant
knight had tried to win the sword; but all in vain.
Buried deep in the ash-stem it remained till Siegmund
came and with one powerful wrench drew
forth the weapon. Then Wotan rejoiced that a
man had been found strong enough to win his
sword, and he loved Siegmund the Volsung
greatly.</p>

<p>But Wotan hated Hunding, for he was a tyrant
and a bully. With all his strength and bluster, he
had never been able to pluck out the sword, though
many a time had he tried, grinding his teeth
savagely over his failure.</p>

<p>Now the cause of strife between Hunding and
Siegmund was this—Hunding had a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
wife, Sieglinda by name, whom he had married
sorely against her will. With her whole soul she
loathed and hated the cruel Hunding, and only
longed to escape from him. So it befell one day
she fled with Siegmund the Volsung; for the first
moment they met, these two loved one another,
and Sieglinda said to herself: “It were better far
to die with Siegmund than to live with Hunding.”</p>

<p>When Hunding discovered their flight, he set
forth to pursue the lovers, uttering loud threats
of vengeance, which echoed through the forest for
miles round.</p>

<p>He called on Fricka, Queen of Valhalla, to help
him, for he knew this goddess to be most stern in
her view of the duties of wives.</p>

<p>“O mighty goddess,” cried Hunding, “grant me
thine aid! May thy justice and my righteous
vengeance speedily overtake the miscreant! Let
not the scoundrel Volsung turn the power of
Wotan’s sword to his own advantage, for then
would all men surely say that the god’s favor rests
on faithless wives!”</p>

<p>Fricka promised him her warm support, and also
that of Wotan, whom she knew she could bend to
her all-powerful will, however opposed he might
feel. Scarcely had Brunhilda left the presence of
her father when the goddess Fricka drove up in a
car drawn by two fierce fleet-footed rams.</p>

<p>With stern majesty she demanded that Siegmund
should be given up to justice, and the magic
sword he had won be broken against the spear of
Wotan himself. It was for the honor of the gods
and Valhalla, cried Fricka, that Hunding’s prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
for vengeance on his faithless wife and her lover
be answered.</p>

<p>In vain did Wotan plead every excuse he could
devise for his favorite Siegmund. Not until he had
solemnly sworn on oath to cast off Siegmund, and
recall the order given to Brunhilda, did the stern
goddess take her leave. Wotan sank on the nearest
rock a picture of utter dejection. In this sad
state Brunhilda found him shortly after. She
listened in dismay, when in gloomy tones he said
to her:</p>

<p>“Thou shalt fight to-day as Fricka desires, and
thou shalt vanquish utterly Siegmund the Volsung!
Heed well my words—my former order I now
recall.”</p>

<p>Brunhilda could scarcely believe she heard
aright. “Nay, but thou lovest Siegmund,” she
cried in sore perplexity, “and Hunding dost thou
hate! Ah,” she continued, as a new thought came
to her, “this second decree is not given with thy
heart! Rather will I abide by the first!”</p>

<p>Brunhilda spoke with good intent, but these
were unlucky words. In many respects the mighty
Wotan was not unlike a mortal man.</p>

<p>“How, froward child! Dost dare dispute my
word?” he cried. “Thou who are naught but the
blind tool used by my hand! Wake not my wrath,
but heed well my command—Siegmund dies in the
fight with Hunding. I have spoken—go!”</p>

<p>In sorrowful amaze the warrior-maiden took up
her weapons and departed. She found the ill-starred
lovers resting awhile in their wanderings
through the trackless forest. Sieglinda’s strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was utterly spent, and she had fallen into a deep
swoon.</p>

<p>“Siegmund the Volsung,” spoke Brunhilda in
solemn tones, “I come to call thee hence!”</p>

<p>“Who art thou, so fair and stern?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Only those already doomed to death may look
upon my face,” she answered. “I am she who
bears the fallen warrior to Valhalla.”</p>

<p>“And will this my love come also to Valhalla?”
asked Siegmund, gazing tenderly at the pale face
of the sleeping Sieglinda.</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied Brunhilda, “such is not the will
of Wotan; Sieglinda must remain upon the earth.
But thou shalt be with heroes, and the daughters
of Wotan shall wait upon thee.”</p>

<p>“If my love may not be there, I will have none of
Valhalla’s delights! I follow thee not!” answered
Siegmund fixedly.</p>

<p>“Thou hast looked on the face of the Valkyrie—thou
hast no choice but to follow her,” said Brunhilda.</p>

<p>“By what warrior’s hand must I fall?” asked
Siegmund.</p>

<p>“Hunding will fell thee in the fight to-day,”
answered the Valkyrie.</p>

<p>But Siegmund laughed this prophecy to scorn.
“Seest thou this sword?” he said, drawing forth
the weapon of Wotan. “It was made by one in
whose name I am sure of victory.”</p>

<p>“He who bestowed that sword now withdraws
the charm, and himself dooms thee to death!” cried
Brunhilda in terrible ringing tones.</p>

<p>“Hush! or thou wilt awaken my love,” said Siegmund,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
bending tenderly over Sieglinda. “If what
thou sayest be true, woe and shame be to him who
bestowed such a sword! If I must perish and
desert her,” he continued bitterly, “never will I
pass to the Valhalla of Wotan.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Brunhilda in horror. “Thou
wouldst forego the glory of Valhalla for the sake
of this poor feeble woman?”</p>

<p>“If thou canst feel no pity, and canst give no
help in my sore distress, then leave me at least in
peace. Speak not of Valhalla’s empty joys.”</p>

<p>How help this heroic lover without disobeying
the order of Wotan her father? “Confide thy beloved
to my care—I will protect her, noble Siegmund,”
she said earnestly.</p>

<p>“I thank thee,” replied Siegmund, “but none
save I alone can protect my love. And if this
sword, which a traitor fashioned, is to prove false
in the fight, better it should take our two lives with
one fell stroke.” So saying, he drew his sword and
held it over Sieglinda. But Brunhilda seized his
arm.</p>

<p>“Stay thy hand, reckless man! Thou shalt not
die, but live. Thou shalt not leave Sieglinda.
Sooner will I, Brunhilda, cancel the death-lot.
Doubt me not, my promise is spoken. Take up
thy sword, it shall prevail, for I will aid thee.
Speed now to meet thy foe. Hark to the sound of
Hunding’s horn! Farewell, Siegmund!”</p>

<p>With these words Brunhilda sprang on her
winged horse, and soon vanished through the
clouds.</p>

<p>Siegmund gazed after her with grateful eyes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
then, stooping, kissed Sieglinda, saying softly:
“Slumber in peace, my beloved, till the fight is
over and peril past.” The horn of Hunding
sounded loudly in the distance, and Siegmund
hastened away to meet him, leaving Sieglinda still
asleep.</p>

<p>A terrible thunderstorm now broke over the
forest, thunderclouds rolled and clashed together.
All was dark as night, no light save from the
forked flashes which darted here and there in fiery
streaks, like the gleaming swords of an unseen
enemy fighting in the clouds.</p>

<p>Louder and louder called the hunting-horns of
Hunding and his followers. Presently a terrific
thunderclap awoke Sieglinda. She started up in
wildest terror. Siegmund was no longer by her
side, a dense darkness surrounded her, while near
at hand rang the voice of Hunding crying in tones
of wrath: “Ha, thou scoundrel Volsung! come out
and fight, or my hounds shall hunt thee down!”</p>

<p>The voices now seemed to come from a rock over
Sieglinda’s head. She listened in eager anxiety as
they continued to shout to one another. Suddenly
a flash of lightning showed them fighting desperately
on a ridge of the rock.</p>

<p>Sieglinda rushed forward, forgetting all fears
for herself in an agony for Siegmund’s safety.
Another blinding flash made her stagger backwards,
dazed and giddy. For one instant the whole
mountain-peak was lit up, and she saw, hovering
over Siegmund in the air, a woman on a winged
horse, covering him with a shield as he fought.</p>

<p>“Now is the moment, Siegmund the Volsung,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
cried a dear voice from above. “Slay him with
thy magic sword!”</p>

<p>But as Siegmund aimed his deadly stroke at
the heart of Hunding, a dreadful disaster befell.
Wotan, standing unseen at Hunding’s side, put
forth his spear and received the thrust of Siegmund’s
sword. “Back before my spear! Be
splintered, thou sword!” roared the voice of the
god in tones of thunder.</p>

<p>With a sharp sound like a cry the sword of
Siegmund snapped and flew to pieces.</p>

<p>Brunhilda fell back in dismay as the gleaming
eye of Wotan met her own; and instantly Hunding
plunged his sword into the heart of his defenseless
foe. Sieglinda fell senseless to the ground. Brunhilda,
gathering up the fragments of the sword,
hurried to her side, and, lifting her to the saddle,
rode off at lightning speed through the clouds.</p>

<p>Siegmund’s lifeless body lay at the feet of
Wotan. Remorsefully he gazed upon the brave
young warrior he would fain have spared. The
sight of Hunding was more than he could bear.
With a backward wave of his hand Wotan cried
fiercely: “Go, knave! Kneel before Fricka and
tell her how well Wotan avenged her slight!”</p>

<p>And at these words Hunding staggered and fell
lifeless to the ground; for no mortal man could
stand before the scornful wave of Wotan’s hand,
unless he were of the race of Heroes who know not
fear.</p>

<p>So Hunding died; but there was no Valkyrie to
bear him to Valhalla. All his life he had been a
tyrant and a bully, and such men, were they the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
best fighters in the world, could find no favor with
the warrior-maidens.</p>

<p>“Now for Brunhilda!” cried Wotan, his voice
causing the very trees to quake and shiver. “She
who has dared to defy and disobey me! Terrible
shall be her punishment, though she be my best-loved
child.”</p>

<p>He sprang on his war-horse and followed where
the parted clouds showed Brunhilda’s recent track.</p>

<h2 id="BRUNHILDAS_SLEEP_GUARDED">BRUNHILDA’S SLEEP GUARDED
BY LOKI’S FIERY ARM</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">On the summit of a lofty mountain the Valkyrie
sisters met after the day’s toil, to await
their father Wotan, and present him with the
heroes they had gathered from the battlefields on
earth.</p>

<p>One by one they alighted from their winged
steeds, shouting the Valkyries’ war-cry greeting to
each other, “Hei-a-ha! Hei-a-hei! Hoyoto-ho!”</p>

<p>From the north came Helmwiga and Gerhilda
well-laden; the fierce Norsemen never failed to
supply fresh recruits for Wotan’s bodyguard.
From east and west and every quarter came some
tribute to Wotan, borne on the Valkyries’ saddle-bows.</p>

<p>“Where tarries our sister Brunhilda?” asked
several eagerly. “She is late to-night. Ah, see,
in the distance, who is that speeding hither like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
cloud driven before the storm? Surely not so rides
our queenly Brunhilda!”</p>

<p>With the fainting Sieglinda in her arms, it was
indeed Brunhilda who came in sight at last, flying
on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>“Faster! oh, faster, Grani my steed!” she cried to
the panting horse.</p>

<p>And Grani, his strong head downward bent, with
his winged feet cleft the rolling clouds till they
hissed like water meeting fire, while his breath came
in great snorting gasps, and the foam flew from his
mouth in big flakes like snow. Never before in his
long service with his noble mistress had Grani been
urged to flight, and he knew that dire indeed must
be the danger which Brunhilda dare not stand and
face.</p>

<p>“Well striven, good Grani, faithful steed!” cried
Brunhilda, as the horse alighted on the mountain
and dropped exhausted to the ground. Lifting
Sieglinda, now fully conscious, from the saddle,
Brunhilda hastened toward her sisters.</p>

<p>“She brings no hero! It is naught but a
maiden!” they exclaimed in wonder and disappointment.</p>

<p>“Help me, O sisters! Shield me and this poor
woman, I beseech you!” implored Brunhilda
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Why this furious haste? From whom fliest
thou?” asked the Valkyries, crowding round her in
amazement.</p>

<p>“I fly from our father! In terrible wrath he
hunts me down!”</p>

<p>“Thou fliest from our father?” cried all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sisters, horror-struck. “What hast thou done that
thou shouldst fly from him?”</p>

<p>Brunhilda poured out her tale in eager haste.
From one to another she looked for pity or
sympathy but in vain. Sternly the Valkyries eyed
her as she knelt and implored them to shelter her
and the unfortunate Sieglinda from the wrath of
Wotan.</p>

<p>“Woe to thee, most unworthy sister! How
durst thou disobey the sacred command of
Wotan our father? Naught but disaster can
follow!”</p>

<p>And now, from the north, raging storm-clouds
came sweeping toward them. One of the Valkyries
mounted to the topmost peak, and, looking across
the sky, called out:</p>

<p>“He comes! Wotan the wrathful father! flying
furiously in the storm-clouds on his snorting
steed!”</p>

<p>“Who will lend me a horse? Grani is spent—see,
he cannot even stand! Rossvisa, my sister,
have pity, lend me thy racer!” Brunhilda implored,
turning to a stately Valkyrie whose magnificent
steed was at her side.</p>

<p>“My racer never yet fled our father in fear, and
never shall!” replied Rossvisa coldly. To each one
Brunhilda went, beseeching a horse.</p>

<p>“We stand by our father!” the Valkyries all
answered her. Brunhilda was in despair.</p>

<p>Then Sieglinda, who had watched the scene in
gloomy silence, came forward and spoke. “Sorrow
not for me, noble maiden. Oh, why didst thou not
leave me to die with Siegmund? If thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
indeed pity on me, stretch forth thy sword and
pierce me now to the heart.”</p>

<p>“Nay, that must not be,” answered Brunhilda.
“Thou must live still, Sieglinda, for thou shalt have
a son, who will one day be the greatest hero in the
world. Heed now what I say. To the eastward
there lies a mighty forest; there Wotan will not
pursue thee, for he abhors the spot. It is the
dwelling of Fafnir the dragon, his mortal foe.
Thither haste thee. I will remain here to face the
god’s wrath, and hinder him till thou hast escaped
far on thy journey.”</p>

<p>“Fly, then, Sieglinda!” cried Brunhilda; “speed
to the east! Faint not and fear not, whatever
betide. Live for thy son, and call him by this name
from me—Siegfried the Victor! Give him these
shattered pieces of his father’s sword—from the
field of death I took them. One day he shall weld
them into a mighty weapon. Farewell, Sieglinda!”
It was none too soon. Another minute, and with
a crash the angry god descended in the midst of
the dismayed Valkyries.</p>

<p>“Where is Brunhilda, the rebel?” he roared in
tones of fury. “Let her come forth! Dare any to
shelter her, they shall share the same doom.”</p>

<p>The Valkyrie sisters had closed round Brunhilda
in the vain hope of hiding her; but at these
words she came out from their midst, her face pale
and set. “Here am I, my father, to suffer my sentence,”
she said firmly.</p>

<p>Wotan was not prepared for such calm fearlessness.
“I sentence thee not,” he answered. “’Tis
thine own misdeed condemns thee!” Then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
gathering wrath, he continued, “I made thee a
Valkyrie, highest in honor and favor. Thou hast
forsworn thy noble calling, and played traitor to
thy father. No longer mayest thou dwell in Valhalla
as my child. Never more will I send thee
for my dead heroes. Never again shalt thou fill
my cup at the feast! Degraded and exiled art thou
forever!”</p>

<p>Brunhilda stood as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>The Valkyries burst into loud lamentations.
“Woe! woe! Alas, our unhappy sister!”</p>

<p>Then Brunhilda cried aloud in great agony of
mind, “O father, disown me not! Take not from
me all thy gifts! Leave me not to utter desolation!”</p>

<p>But Wotan was not to be appeased, and the
worst part of the sentence was yet to come. “Thou
thyself hast called down my curse, and here where
we now stand it shall strike thee!” he answered.
“A deep, dreamless sleep shall overpower thee, and
to that man who first awakens thee shalt thou
belong from henceforth!”</p>

<p>At this grim sentence all the Valkyries lifted
their voices in a wail of horror and dismay, crying:
“Oh, terrible father, recall the curse! Let not our
sister be degraded to such a shameful fate. Each
one of us shares in her disgrace.”</p>

<p>Brunhilda’s woe was too great for any cry.</p>

<p>“I have spoken once—my words abide forever!”
retorted Wotan. “Thy treacherous sister,” he
continued, “no longer belongs to the glorious troop
of Valkyries. Her godhood is forfeit! The doom
she has earned is now to wed a mortal man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>At this picture of her future, poor Brunhilda
sank with a deep groan to the earth.</p>

<p>Wotan turned to the eight sisters, who looked
on in deep distress. “If ye desire not a like doom,
forbear to pity the outcast. Away now, begone,
every one of ye! Haste, lest I hurl the same woe
on your heads!” The earth quaked and trembled
as Wotan passionately stamped his foot, and fiery
gleams shot from his eyes.</p>

<p>With a last despairing look at Brunhilda and
a wild cry of woe, the Valkyries sprang on their
horses and fled in hot haste. They knew if their
stern father spared not his favorite Brunhilda, still
less would he spare them.</p>

<p>The storm had now ceased. Brunhilda lay prostrate
on the ground. Wotan stood motionless in
silent gloom. His rage seemed spent, like that of
the storm. Then Brunhilda rose slowly from the
ground, and spoke in deep sorrowful tones. “Was
my deed verily so shameful that such shame should
fall upon me? Was it so base an act to fulfil thy
<em>first</em> command? Speak, O my father, and soften
thy wrath toward me.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst wilfully disobey my sacred order.
The <em>first</em> command I recalled,” replied Wotan
bitterly.</p>

<p>“But not of thine own will. ’Twas Fricka who
made thee false to thy nobler self; and because I
held in my heart thy true wish, I dared to slight
thy second order.”</p>

<p>The mention of Fricka brought an angry flash
from the eyes of Wotan. “For that rebellious act
the curse now falls on thee,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I knew how well thou lovedst Siegmund,”
pleaded Brunhilda; “and when I found him in the
forest and told him of thy death decree, he revealed
to me a wondrous thing I never before had known.
For in his strong courage and his undying devotion
to Sieglinda, I learned what love could be. And I
resolved, whether victory or death came of it, to
serve one so noble. In acting thus, O father, I was
faithful to thee, even though disobeying thereby thy
command.”</p>

<p>Wotan groaned. “Thou knowest naught of
what compelled my action. Dark clouds are
gathering on every side—the day of doom threatens
Valhalla! I dared not follow what my heart
desired. But all this woe I kept from thee, that
thy life might be happy and free from care. And
thou, my favorite, my beloved child, hast turned
thy hand against me and proved false to my trust.
Never again may I behold thy face! Since love
proved thy undoing, follow now that man whom
thou perforce must love.”</p>

<p>“If indeed I am banished forever, at least,” she
pleaded, “grant me one parting boon, O stern
father. If I must wed a mortal man, let not thy
Valkyrie fall a victim to some worthless poltroon,
when fetters of sleep bind her fast. In this one
thing, O father, hear my prayer—at thy command
let magical fire spring up in a glowing wall around
my couch, that the flames may scare and scorch the
timid, and none save a hero stout of heart may dare
to approach me.”</p>

<p>Wotan, stern and unbending though he was,
could not refuse this one last petition. “Farewell,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he said, “thou who wert once the light of my eyes.
I grant thee this last parting boon—tongues of
flame will I set round this place; with their terrible
fury shall they scare the faint-hearted. Only one
shall awaken the bride, he whose strength and freedom
is greater than that of Wotan.”</p>

<p>With a cry of grateful joy Brunhilda threw
herself into her father’s arm. Tenderly he looked
at her, and slowly kissed her on both eyes. A
profound slumber instantly fell on Brunhilda, and
Wotan, taking her in his arms, laid her on a mossy
mound overshadowed by a great fir tree.</p>

<p>“Farewell forever, my beloved beautiful child,”
he murmured sadly, as he closed her helmet visor
and covered her with the long steel shield of the
Valkyries.</p>

<p>Then, going to a rock near by, he struck it three
times with the point of his spear, commanding in a
loud voice: “Loki! Fire-spirit, come forth. Spread
me thy flames around this fell. Here keep thou
guard as I decree. Loki, appear!”</p>

<p>And at his word, out sprang from the rock a
long tongue of flame, which quickly spread to a
mighty river of fire circling round and round the
mountain where Brunhilda lay sleeping.</p>

<p>Then Wotan, holding aloft his spear, cried in
ringing tones: “Only he whose spirit quaileth not
before the spear of Wotan shall pass this fiery bar!”
With these words he vanished into the clouds, and
the night fell.</p>

<p>Such was the story of Brunhilda’s long sleep.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_SIEGFRIED_KILLED_THE">HOW SIEGFRIED KILLED THE
DRAGON</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">When Sieglinda fled from the wrath of
Wotan, she went eastward, as Brunhilda
directed. For long days and nights she journeyed,
and came at length to the country of the Nibelungs,
where dwelt the great dragon Fafnir.</p>

<p>Now the Nibelungs were a race of ugly dwarfs,
who lived underground, burrowing in the depths
of the earth for gold and treasure. They cared
nothing for the free forest life, the sunshine, trees,
and flowers, or pleasures of the chase. Like prisoners
in a dungeon, they chose rather to pass their
lives digging and toiling in the dark for gold, and
hoarding it up with anxious care.</p>

<p>A vast heap of this treasure, including a magic
Ring, stolen from the Mermaids of the Rhine, and
a Wishing Cap of strange powers called the Tarnhelm,
had fallen into the hands of Fafnir the giant,
who, in order the better to guard these precious possessions,
transformed himself into a huge dragon,
the terror of all the country round.</p>

<p>Sieglinda lived a sad, lonely life in the forest.
She avoided the caves where Fafnir dwelt, and as
the dwarfs seldom came above ground, she saw
nothing of them.</p>

<p>There was one, however, whom it was fated she
should meet. His name was Mimi, and of all the
dwarfs of the Nibelung race he was the ugliest
and the meanest. Notwithstanding this, he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
very skilful blacksmith, and could also do fine work
in gold, silver, and steel. Like all the Nibelungs,
he had a great dislike to fresh air, so he built his
forge in a cave half sunk underground, with a great
chimney in the roof.</p>

<p>Mimi was working at his anvil one day, when he
heard a deep groan outside the cave. On going
out, he saw a woman with a baby in her arms lying
on the ground. She was dying, and Mimi had only
found her in time to hear her last words.</p>

<p>“Have pity!” cried poor Sieglinda (for it was
she). “Thy goodness shall be rewarded. I am
dying. Take this my son and bring him up. Call
his name Siegfried, for one day he will be the greatest
hero in the world. Keep for him this broken
sword—it was Siegmund his father’s—‘Needful,’
he called it!”</p>

<p>Now Mimi was not a kind-hearted person, and
nothing would have induced him to take care of a
strange baby out of pity. But when Sieglinda said
that her child was the son of the famous hero Siegmund
the Volsung, and would one day himself be
the greatest hero in the world, then a grand idea
struck Mimi. He would bring up the boy as his
own son, and when Siegfried was full-grown, he
should be sent forth to kill Fafnir and win for his
foster-father all the dragon’s treasure!</p>

<p>So Mimi answered Sieglinda in a cracked voice,
which he tried to make pleasant:</p>

<p>“Be comforted, poor woman. I will take the
child out of the kindness of my heart, and do my
best for him.”</p>

<p>Sieglinda died with a blessing on her lips, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Mimi took the little Siegfried to dwell with him in
his cave.</p>

<p>But the dwarf soon found he had no easy task
in bringing up this son of a hero. Never was such
a daring, fearless, mischievous infant. Many a
time would Mimi have turned him adrift, or put an
end to him with a blow from his smith’s hammer,
but for the thought that this bold young imp was
just the sort to delight in slaying a dragon, and
pay no heed as to who took the treasure.</p>

<p>As soon as he could walk, the boy would escape
into the forest, and there run wild all day; chasing
the bears and foxes, feeling no fear of any living
creature. He grew so fast that in a few years he
was bigger and stronger than Mimi, whom from
the first he disliked, perceiving the dwarf to be false
and cowardly in all his actions.</p>

<p>Mimi always told the boy he was his father, and
this was a great trouble to Siegfried. How he
would have loved a father who was noble, fearless,
and brave! But Mimi feared everything. He
trembled and turned pale did a wolf but howl, or
the thunder roll. He feared not only giants, but
ordinary huntsmen and woodcutters, and always
hid when they came in sight. He feared even Siegfried,
so the boy soon became his master, and led
him a sorry life. But creatures too small and weak
to excite his fear Mimi would cruelly oppress and
kill; and this, more than anything else, made Siegfried
hate the very sight of him.</p>

<p>Time went on, and Siegfried grew into a tall
strong youth, with fair locks shining in the sun
like burnished gold, and fearless blue eyes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
laughed danger in the face. At last the day came
when Mimi hoped to be repaid for all his trouble
with “the good-for-nothing cub,” as he called the
boy. Siegfried had ordered him in a lordly way to
make a sword fit for his use—“one that does not
snap in two at the first stroke,” he said, and strode
off to the forest for his day’s hunt.</p>

<p>Mimi had undertaken the task more than once
lately, for he was anxious on his own account that
a sword should be fashioned strong and tough
enough to slay the dragon. But as yet every
weapon he welded had snapped in two at the first
trial of its strength by Siegfried.</p>

<p>With mighty effort Mimi hammered and
wrought at his anvil all that day. “A stouter sword
I never shaped! It would defy a giant,” he said
at last, looking on his day’s work. “Yet I sorely
fear, when grasped by that fiery youth, it will twist
up like a straw!”</p>

<p>Mimi sat down exhausted and despairing. “Ah
me! What is to be done?” he sighed. “If only
Siegmund’s splintered sword could be welded together
again! But no power on earth can do that!
Never saw I such mighty steel—all my craft is powerless
to melt it—the thing is magic!”</p>

<p>“Oho! Come on, friend Bruin!” cried a voice
from without, and Siegfried burst into the cave,
driving a great grisly bear, which he held in tow
with a rope.</p>

<p>Mimi started up in terror, and hid behind the
forge shrieking: “Take away the fearsome brute!”</p>

<p>Siegfried burst into peals of laughter at Mimi’s
fear. “Mr. Bruin is a friend of mine. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
come to ask for the sword—is it not finished
yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is finished. There it lies yonder. Take
away the beast!” panted Mimi.</p>

<p>Siegfried seized the sword eagerly. “Go now,
friend Bruin,” he said, loosing the rope, and the
bear gladly escaped.</p>

<p>“See how nice and bright is the sword,” said
Mimi, creeping out of his hiding-place.</p>

<p>“To what purpose is a sword bright if it is not
hard?” asked Siegfried, with scorn. He struck it
on the anvil, and the sword instantly flew to pieces.
“What silly toy hast thou palmed off on me here?”
he cried, flinging it away in disgust. “Dost call
that a sword? Why talk to me of battles, and
giants, and deeds of daring, if thou canst shape me
no better weapon than that? Right well dost thou
deserve that I break it on thy crazy old head!”</p>

<p>“Ungrateful boy! Think of all my goodness to
thee! When a wretched, troublesome cub, who
was it warmed, clothed, and fed thee? Who patiently
taught thee all thou knowest? And what is
my reward? naught but abuse and hate!” Mimi
pretended to wipe away a tear, as though overcome
by grief; but he had done this once too often.</p>

<p>“No doubt thou hast taught me much, and told
me many lies,” answered Siegfried, who was in no
mood for polite speeches. “But there is one thing,”
he continued, “thou hast never taught me, and
which I am now determined to know—Who and
from whence are my father and mother? Long
have I felt thou art no kin of mine. I see in the
forest all the young resemble their parents; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thou and I are no more like than a toad and a
bright shining fish!”</p>

<p>Mimi did not like the comparison. His eyes
gleamed with hate.</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth, or I will shake it out
of thee!” cried Siegfried, seizing him by the
throat.</p>

<p>“Let loose, or thou wilt murder me, wretched
boy!” screamed the dwarf in terror. “I will tell
thee all!” Then, trembling and quaking, he told
Siegfried all he knew of his unhappy parents, with
many comments on his own exceeding kindness, to
which Siegfried listened impatiently. Finally, in
proof of his tale (which, for a wonder, was true),
Mimi produced the two pieces of splintered sword,
saying dolefully—“Behold, as reward for all my
toil and trouble, this had I from thy mother!—a
broken sword thy father died while wielding—‘Needful,’
they called it—a foolish name, since it
failed in time of need!”</p>

<p>Siegfried rejoiced at learning that he sprang
from a noble race. He thought with tenderness of
his unfortunate parents, and wished he could have
brought some comfort to his poor brave mother.
Eagerly he seized the broken pieces of his father’s
sword. “To me it shall be well named ‘Needful’,”
he cried. “If thou hast any craft, show it now,
Mimi. Up and forge me these fragments! My
father’s sword I will wield to-day, and with it go
forth into the world.” So saying, he went out of
the cave, leaving Mimi looking disconsolately at
the broken sword.</p>

<p>“No furnace can melt this hard steel. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
hammer can bend it. Yet this is the sword which
alone can slay Fafnir!”</p>

<p>When Siegfried returned Mimi had still done
nothing. He seemed to have just awakened from
some bad dream.</p>

<p>“Ho, lazy fellow! Hast finished the sword?” he
shouted.</p>

<p>Mimi crept up slowly from behind the anvil, looking
round cautiously, lest Siegfried had brought
some wild beast with him. “The sword?” he exclaimed
in dismal tones. “How can I mend such
steel? But, hark ye, boy”; and Mimi came close
up, peering into his face; “hast ever known Fear?”</p>

<p>“Whom meanest thou by Fear? Never have I
heard of him!” Siegfried answered impatiently.</p>

<p>“Alone in the forest on a dark night, near some
gloomy spot, when a sudden rustle or roar startled
thee close at hand, hast never felt grisly shudderings,
thy heart beating and bursting in thy breast?”</p>

<p>The little dwarf’s description of his unknown
feeling interested Siegfried greatly. He even forgot
to be angry about the sword. “Right strange
and wondrous must that be,” he cried. “My heart
is ever firm and steady—how I long to feel sensations
so new and curious—this shivering and shaking
and beating and bursting! Tell me then,
Mimi, how can I learn to know Fear?”</p>

<p>“I will tell thee!” said Mimi, delighted. “There
is one I know of who will not fail to teach thee. A
monstrous dragon he is, Fafnir by name. I will
guide thee to his hole.”</p>

<p>“Where is it? Let us be gone at once. Give
me the sword, I will mend it myself. Verily thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
art but a bungling smith.” Heaping a mass of
wood on the fire, Siegfried blew it up till the flames
roared like hungry lions. Then, fixing the sword-splinters
in a vice, he proceeded to file them to
powder.</p>

<p>Mimi watched in wonder and envy. Now and
then he timidly offered his advice, to which Siegfried
paid as much heed as though it were the
squeaking of a mouse.</p>

<p>Working away with a will, Siegfried performed
the mightiest feats of strength with no more exertion
than if he were shaping a toy for a child.
When the sword was all in powder, he put it in a
pot on the forge. Then, blowing up the flames
afresh, he sang in a voice strong as a clarion a joyful
song of freedom and victory.</p>

<p>The steel sword of his father seemed to understand
the song, for it bubbled and spluttered all
liquid in the pot, as though it would leap out for
very joy.</p>

<p>Mimi listened, too, but he did not enjoy the song.
His wily brain was hard at work planning his own
ends. That Siegfried should remake the sword was
very well, for without it Fafnir could not be slain—but
supposing he took the Ring, the gold, and all?—what
then would become of poor Mimi? So he
prepared a wonderful draught of such powerful
poisons, that one drop was enough to make a giant
fall senseless to the ground. “When he comes home
weary from his fight with the dragon, I will give
him this refreshing cup,” said Mimi, with a malicious
chuckle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Siegfried poured the molten steel into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a mould, which he forthwith plunged hissing into a
tank of cold water. “Ha, ha, Mimi!” he cried. “So
you have turned cook, and brew sauces while I brew
swords! Methinks,” he added to himself, “I would
rather taste of my cooking than his!”</p>

<p>The dwarf’s sharp little eyes glistened with hate
as he stirred the potion, and crooned low his song
of hope and vengeance. “So the pupil puts the
craftsman to shame, does he? Only let him wait
till this draught is duly prepared!”</p>

<p>“Now, Needful, come forth, and see what the
hammer can do for thee!” cried Siegfried.</p>

<p>He took the sword hard and cold from the water,
and thrust it in the red-hot coals till it glowed like
a sword of flame. Then with a huge smith’s
hammer, he beat it out on the anvil. The sparks
flew right and left like fireflies, and Siegfried sang
again:</p>

<p>“Ha, Needful! So do I tame thy spirit! At
my command thou glowest fiery red—then in the
water I cool thine anger till thy sides gleam steely
blue! Now with stalwart strokes I beat thee out,
Needful, my famous sword—so does my spirit enter
thee! Soon thy cold blade shall glow red again
with the blood of traitors! Dead didst thou lie,
but I, Siegfried, give thee life once more. Needful,
come forth!”</p>

<p>Brandishing the sword, Siegfried brought down
a mighty stroke across the anvil. With a crash it
split from top to bottom, giving Mimi such a shock
he nearly upset his precious pot.</p>

<p>So the sword was remade, and Siegfried forthwith
started out, guided by Mimi, to find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
dragon. Darkness had fallen, but Siegfried was
too impatient for his first lesson in fear to wait till
morning. All night they tramped through the
forest. At every rustle of the branches, every
snapping of a twig, Mimi started as though he
were shot. Siegfried watched him with scorn; his
mocking laughter re-echoed through the stillness.</p>

<p>And the dwarf’s hatred grew more bitter with
every step. Many a time he longed then and there
to force down Siegfried’s throat the draught he
carried so carefully under his cloak.</p>

<p>On they went, Siegfried scarcely heeding the
way, so high bounded his heart with thoughts of
adventure. To fight and conquer giants and dragons—to
go out into the wide world and be free as
air—free from the false, cowardly Mimi—free to
choose brave and noble companions whom he could
honor and love! What unknown joys might not
life he waiting to give him who dared to win
them!</p>

<p>Day was dawning when at length they reached
some rocky caverns at the foot of a mountainous
chain. “This is the spot,” said Mimi in a trembling
whisper. “Seest thou yonder dark, yawning hole?
Inside lies Fafnir. Day and night he guards his
treasure—the gold, the Ring, and the Tarnhelm.”</p>

<p>“So he is the master who will teach me Fear?”
cried Siegfried joyfully. “Thou canst leave me
now, Mimi—I need thee no more.”</p>

<p>“Ungrateful boy!” sighed the dwarf. “But I
will not go far. My heart will be torn with anxiety
for thy safety. Fafnir is no common foe—with
a single snap he could swallow thee whole!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Siegfried laughed. “I shall be careful not to thrust
myself down such a wide throat!”</p>

<p>“Eh, but his very breath is potent poison,” continued
Mimi, “and the foam of his mouth, if it but
touch thee, will shrivel up both flesh and bones on
the spot. While as to his tail, ’tis like a huge
snake, which, once thou art in its coils, will grind
thy limbs as though they were powdered glass!”</p>

<p>Mimi hastened away, muttering to himself,
“Would that the dragon and the boy might slay
one another!”</p>

<p>Siegfried threw himself down under the trees to
wait for Fafnir. A bird began to sing in the
branches overhead. Siegfried listened, and wished
he could understand the bird’s language. “Perchance
if I but knew it, he sings to me of my
mother, and of all I wish to know!”</p>

<p>Siegfried gazed up between the leaves at the
bird, which paused for a moment, and fixed on
him a pair of little black eyes; then started afresh,
gurgling forth his liquid notes and trills.</p>

<p>“The language of the birds may be learned, so I
have heard tell!” cried Siegfried, and swinging up,
he went down to the stream and cut a reed with
his sword. With much trouble he fashioned a pipe,
and returning to his friend in the tree, tried to
imitate his music. The bird stopped to listen, much
surprised. But it was a sorry performance, and
though this bird was too polite to laugh, Siegfried
distinctly heard a tittering and fluttering from
other listeners. Much disheartened, he flung away
the reed.</p>

<p>“It is no use!” he cried. “I alone in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
world have no friend, no companion with whom I
can speak. Well, at least, I will try if there is anyone
will understand <em>this</em> language.” He took the
silver horn slung round his neck and blew a ringing
challenge. It was answered in a moment by a
low roar from the distant cave, followed soon by
slow, crashing steps and deep-drawn snorts coming
nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Presently Siegfried beheld an enormous wriggling
mass of shining scales advancing toward him.
“So my call has awakened this lovely creature,” he
laughed, as the hideous monster came full in view.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked a thick, guttural voice,
and the dragon paused to gaze in wonder and contempt
at the youth who faced him with such bold
laughing eyes.</p>

<p>“So thou hast the gift of speech, Mr. Dragon?
That is well!” remarked Siegfried lightly. “I have
come to learn from thee, what is Fear.”</p>

<p>“Overbold art thou,” growled the voice, while
from enormous jaws issued a volume of fire and
smoke, filling the air with a noisome vapor.</p>

<p>“Bold or overbold, here am I to learn my
lesson—so teach me without delay!” answered
Siegfried. Fafnir opened his yawning jaws and
showed two rows of jagged, pointed teeth, enormous
in size.</p>

<p>“Verily thou hast a fine row of grinders, Mr.
Dragon!” laughed Siegfried. “A most dainty
little mouth!”</p>

<p>“I open not my jaw for senseless gabble, but for
food!” growled Fafnir, and gave his tail a sudden
switch round, which would certainly have caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Siegfried in its toils, had he not sprung alertly to
one side.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! so that is the game, is it? Come on
then, Mr. Dragon!” and Siegfried drew Needful
sharply from the scabbard.</p>

<p>“Bah! Come on, thou boasting young cub! I
will give the lesson thou cravest!”</p>

<p>Fafnir drew himself together and sent forth
from his nostrils a venomous steam. Whatever it
touched, whether trees or grass, shrivelled up instantly,
as though scorched by fire. But again
Siegfried was too quick for him, and Fafnir, who
hoped to see a burnt-up body on the ground, was
enraged to hear a cheerful voice behind him—“Look
out, old growler! the ‘boaster’ is upon thee.”</p>

<p>Then Fafnir set to work in good earnest, and
Siegfried found that after all it was no child’s play
to fight a dragon. But though blinded and well-nigh
choked with the poisonous smoke and steam,
Siegfried fought on, nothing daunted. The only
vital spot was, he knew, the dragon’s heart, the
back and sides of his huge carcass being entirely
covered with scaly armor.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they closed on one another,
till at last Fafnir, with a sudden twist, caught Siegfried
in his serpentine tail. But before the coils
had time to tighten round him, Siegfried had
pierced Needful through a joint of the scaly tail.
Fafnir sent up a howl of rage and pain, and for a
moment relaxed his grip. With a bound Siegfried
leapt on the back of his foe. Fafnir instantly prepared
to roll over on one side and so crush Siegfried
with his mountainous weight; but in turning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
his breast for a brief moment was exposed, and in
the twinkling of an eye down swept the sword of
Siegfried, burying itself up to the hilt in the dragon’s
heart.</p>

<p>With a terrific groan Fafnir rolled over, while
Siegfried sprang lightly to one side, crying: “Lie
there, old growler, with Needful in thy heart!” In
great puffs of smoke and fire, like an overturned
steam-engine, came Fafnir’s dying breath. His
eyes rolled horribly; fixing them at last on Siegfried,
he gasped, “Who art thou, clear-eyed
youth?”</p>

<p>“In truth,” replied Siegfried, “I know but little
of myself or of my kin.”</p>

<p>“A strange fate is mine!” groaned the dragon.
“I, the great giant Fafnir, to die by the hand of a
youth unknown even to himself! Young hero,
heed well the dying words of him whom thou hast
slain. The treasure I guarded is accursed. Death
it brought to my brother, and now to me. If thou
touch aught of it, the curse rests also on thee.
Heed what I say!”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me more, wise monster!” Siegfried entreated.
“Tell me of my parents, and the race
from which they sprang. Siegfried is my name!”</p>

<p>Fafnir heaved himself upwards in a last effort
to speak. “Siegfried”—he began, gasped for
breath and then with a deep groan fell back
dead.</p>

<p>As he rolled over on his side, Siegfried drew the
sword out of his breast. He felt sorry the giant
was dead, and had now quite a kindly feeling for
him. Those last words had shown him to be a wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and thoughtful monster. But still, Siegfried was
not sure he would take his advice. In drawing out
the sword, some of the dragon’s blood chanced to
touch Siegfried’s hand. It burnt like a red-hot
coal, and he put it quickly to his mouth. As he
did so, the song of the bird again fell on his ear.
He listened in amazement—for now every note
was a word which he understood!</p>

<p>This was what the bird sang in his sweet piping
voice: “Hey, Siegfried! Siegfried the Victor has
slain the dragon! Now to him belongs the gold,
the Ring, and the Tarnhelm. With these he can
conquer the world if he will.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, little feathered friend, for thy good
news—I will go and seek for these treasures!” and
nodding to the bird, Siegfried descended into
Fafnir’s dark cave.</p>

<p>Mimi, from a safe hiding-place in the trees, had
watched the fight between Fafnir and Siegfried.
He now crept out, and anxiously peeped after
Siegfried as he disappeared into the dragon’s hole.
“Grant, O ye gods, that he take only the gold, and
leave the Ring and the Cap for me!” prayed Mimi
fervently.</p>

<p>Little did he guess how the singing bird had told
Siegfried all he desired to keep most secret. He
thought, “The bright, glittering gold will be sure
to attract the youth more than a plain simple ring
and a small cap of wrought chain.” Presently
Siegfried came out of the cave. Mimi crawled
stealthily back to his hiding-place and peered out
through the leaves.</p>

<p>“A curse on him!” he muttered, grinding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
teeth with rage. “The Ring is on his finger, and
the Cap hangs from his belt!”</p>

<p>Siegfried looked round for his piping friend;
perched on the branch of a lime tree the bird
awaited him.</p>

<p>“Hey! Siegfried has now both Ring and Cap!
Siegfried the Victor! But oh, he must beware of
the treacherous dwarf! The dragon’s blood will
reveal to him the hidden meaning of all words—both
true and false. His <em>thoughts</em> shall Siegfried
hear when the dwarf Mimi speaks.”</p>

<p>Carefully carrying his poisonous draught, Mimi
now approached.</p>

<p>“Thou art tired after thy mighty conflict. See
what I bring to restore thee! Take but a sip, and
all I have worked and waited for will be mine—sword,
treasure, and all.” Mimi thought he was
saying something very pleasant. He smiled and
cringed as he offered the drinking-horn. But these
were his thoughts as Siegfried heard them, in virtue
of his newly gained power.</p>

<p>“So thou wouldst rob me of everything, even of
life?” asked Siegfried sternly.</p>

<p>“How falsely dost thou distort my kind words!”
replied Mimi in an injured tone. “Yet I give myself
much trouble to disguise my true thoughts.
Dear heart, thee and thy kin have I ever hated.”
(Mimi here looked lovingly at Siegfried.) “All
these years I fostered thee, that thou mightest win
for me the dragon’s hoard. Come, now, take the
draught; thou wert ever easy to fool.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>From the painting by K. Dielitz</i></p>

</div>

<p>Siegfried looked at the little dwarf and smiled
ominously. “I should be right glad of a goodly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
draught,” he said. “Of what didst thou make
this?”</p>

<p>“Only drink and see, dear sonny. Trust to my
skill. Soon wilt thou be lying in a deathly swoon
at my feet. Then, with thine own brave sword, off
goes thy head! And Mimi will rest in peace with
the hoard.”</p>

<p>“So—I am to be murdered in my sleep?” asked
Siegfried.</p>

<p>“What folly dost thou talk! Who spoke of
murder? All I thought of doing was just to chop
off thy head when thou liest insensible. A small
return for the shameful treatment I have so long
suffered at thy hands. Come, drink and die, thou
hateful Volsung cub;” and Mimi, still smiling and
leering, thrust the drinking-horn near Siegfried’s
lips.</p>

<p>“Taste thou my sword, false snake!” cried Siegfried.
With a sudden movement of disgust and fury
he struck at the dwarf with his sword. The next
instant Mimi lay dead on the ground. Siegfried
threw his body inside the dragon’s cave, crying:
“Lie there with the gold thou so lovest. I make
thee a parting gift of it. And here is a famous
watch-dog to scare away all thieves.” With this
Siegfried dragged the body of the dragon to the
mouth of the cave, thereby entirely blocking up
the entrance.</p>

<p>Then he turned away from the spot with a sigh
of relief, and went back to the lime tree, where first
the bird had sung to him. Throwing himself down
under the shady branches, he called to his little
friend: “Come, sing to me, happy bird. Alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
am I in all the world. Never have I known a comrade
save the hateful dwarf yonder. Tell me, O
wise little prophet, where shall I find one I can
love?”</p>

<p>All was stillness in the forest. The sun was now
at its height. Only the soft, low hum of insect life
filled the drowsy air.</p>

<p>Suddenly a flutter of wings overhead, and the
clear note of the wood-bird piped out once more:
“Hey, Siegfried the Victor! He has slain the
treacherous dwarf. Now a glorious bride awaits
him. But he must go through the flames to win
and to wake her, for Brunhilda sleeps fast, guarded
by Loki’s fiery arm.”</p>

<p>Siegfried started to his feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, sweetest song! How it fills my heart with
joy and longing! Say, dear bird, how shall I find
this bride, and break through the fire?”</p>

<p>Then the bird sang again: “Only he who knows
not Fear can awaken and win the sleeping bride.”</p>

<p>At this Siegfried laughed aloud with delight;
for had not even Fafnir failed to teach him fear?
“Perchance, from Brunhilda shall I learn to know
what is Fear,” he cried gaily. “Fly on before,
sweet bird; point thou the road; I follow thee!”</p>

<p>The bird fluttered his wings joyfully and flew on
ahead, Siegfried following with bounding step.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_SIEGFRIED_FINDS">HOW SIEGFRIED FINDS
BRUNHILDA</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">For many a day Siegfried journeyed, keeping
the bird always in sight. At night he slept
under a tree, and the bird rested in a branch above,
but with the first whisper of dawn Siegfried would
start up, impatient to be off again.</p>

<p>Over mountain and valley, across river and lake,
Siegfried followed as though his feet were shod
with invisible wings, never flagging, never weary.
He came at length one evening to a narrow pass in
the mountains. The way seemed to lead upwards,
but daylight was fading, and Siegfried could see
nothing clearly. All at once the bird circled rapidly
over his head, sang a few sweet half-plaintive notes,
and then, soaring upwards, vanished out of sight.</p>

<p>In the same moment a deep voice spoke close at
hand: “Halt! What seekest thou here?”</p>

<p>Siegfried went forward, and standing in the
narrow way he saw a tall dark form. “I seek for
the fire-girt mountain where the beautiful maiden
sleeps,” answered Siegfried fearlessly. “Canst
thou tell me the way?”</p>

<p>“Who told thee of such a maiden?” demanded
the stranger sternly.</p>

<p>“A singing bird gave me the good news,” said
Siegfried. “By tasting the blood of a dragon I
learned the language of the birds, and I know my
bird spake true.” He was getting impatient at
so many questions and anxious to go on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“So! thou hast slain old Fafnir. And with what
weapon didst strike the death-blow, bold youth?”
The stranger was in no hurry, evidently.</p>

<p>“With my father’s splintered sword, which I
welded together again,” said Siegfried, with pride.</p>

<p>“But who first shaped that mighty sword?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“That I neither know nor care. ’Twas a mighty
useless weapon till I took it in hand, that I know,”
answered Siegfried. “If thou canst not direct me
on the road I seek, hold thy peace and let me
pass on my way.”</p>

<p>“Softly, young sir! Thou dost not know with
whom thou speakest.”</p>

<p>“I know that this path leads onwards to my
lady, for thither pointed the bird before he left me.
So make way and let me pass,” returned Siegfried
angrily.</p>

<p>“The bird fled to save its life. The way it
pointed thou shalt never pass, presumptuous
youth.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! And who art <em>thou</em> to arrest my steps?”
laughed Siegfried scornfully.</p>

<p>“I am the Guardian of yon mountain, where
sleeps the maiden Brunhilda! A wall of flame encircles
her, which even to approach would scorch
thee to death. Begone then, rash fool, for to win
thy way one step farther, thou must first overcome
the mountain’s Guardian.”</p>

<p>Placing himself in the middle of the road, the
stranger loomed above Siegfried gigantic and immovable
as the rock itself.</p>

<p>But Siegfried remained unawed. “Begone thyself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
old boaster!” he cried irreverently. “Think
not to scare me with such tales. I love the fire’s
blaze! So out of my way, for I haste to where
Brunhilda sleeps.”</p>

<p>“Thou fearest not the fire?” retorted the stranger,
“Then fear this my Spear, for it shall bar thy way—this
Spear, which once already has shattered thy
father’s sword.”</p>

<p>The sky had now become lurid; a terrific tempest
was gathering. At the stranger’s words, Siegfried
sprang forward, and, drawing Needful from
the scabbard, shouted exultingly: “Have I then
found my father’s foe? Thanks be to the gods for
letting me avenge his death!”</p>

<p>Then, falling on the powerful form that barred
his way, he hewed with long, swift strokes at the
Spear, which, had he hesitated one moment, or
made one false step, would have struck him dead.</p>

<p>There was a rushing sound of wings in the storm-clouds
overhead. Anxious faces peered down on
the scene. The warrior maidens, hovering above on
their war-horses, trembled and paled as they beheld
the Spear which once had been the terror of the
world hewn to pieces, while their father, recoiling
at last before the fiery youth, cried half triumphantly,
in spite of his defeat: “Advance! I cannot
bar thy way.” For Wotan’s heart never failed to
rejoice in a real hero, even though he fought against
him.</p>

<p>A terrific clap of thunder followed, and a dark
cloud swept over the fighters. When it rolled
away, Siegfried looked in vain for his mysterious
foe. He had vanished. “Now through the fire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
win my bride!” cried Siegfried joyously, and leapt
up the mountain side.</p>

<p>A ruddy glow soon told him he was nearing
the fiery wall, and gusts of hot air swept across
his face. Taking his silver horn, Siegfried blew a
call which echoed far and near. “To greet my
sleeping love!” he cried.</p>

<p>And now the fire was all about him, bursting up
under his feet, pouring down from the skies, rushing
round on every side. “Aha! This is glorious!”
shouted Siegfried, plunging eagerly onwards, and
laughing. The fierce flames which had scared so
many nearly to death did not scorch even a hair of
Siegfried’s head. For the magic fire injured only
those who retreated—he who dashed fearlessly onward
remained unharmed.</p>

<p>Higher and higher up the mountain went Siegfried.
Emerging at last from the flames, he found
himself on the summit of a rocky peak, clad with
tall dark pine trees.</p>

<p>He looked around him, and rejoiced for very
joy to be alive in such a fair world. The stillness
was wonderful. Not a sound could be heard, for
the wood-bird will not build his home so near the
sky, and the fire had kept out all wingless intruders.</p>

<p>Presently Siegfried saw, standing motionless
under the trees, a stately horse. On going nearer,
he was astonished to find that on his feet were
wings. His eyes were closed in profound sleep.
Siegfried stroked his flowing name. “Awake good
steed! The sun has arisen. This is no time for
sleeping.” His voice rang out clear as his silver
horn, and with a start, Grani awoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>But Siegfried looked around in vain for the bride—Brunhilda.
Suddenly the rising sun struck with
its glittering light on an object under a distant
pine. Siegfried hastened forward, and with wonder
beheld a sleeping form clad from head to foot
in shining armor. “Here is some warrior, for
sure,” cried Siegfried. “This heavy helmet must
press sorely on his head; I will loosen it for him.”</p>

<p>He stooped, lifted the shield, and then carefully
unfastened the helmet. As he removed it, the
sleeper’s hair rolled out in long curling locks of
burnished gold. Siegfried started. Never had
he seen anything so fair as that calm proud young
face, framed in the wavy shining curls.</p>

<p>So still lay the sleeping warrior, so motionless,
Siegfried bent down and listened anxiously for the
deep slow breathing. “This coat of mail must
weigh heavily on him; I will open it,” he said. But
in vain he sought to find a fastening: everywhere
the iron rings closed tightly round. To Siegfried,
who had never seen a soldier, and knew of no
weapon save a sword, this iron garment seemed a
terrible inconvenience, almost as cumbersome as old
Fafnir’s scales. He determined to free the young
warrior, that he might at least sleep in comfort.</p>

<p>So, taking out his sword, he carefully cut through
the rings of mail down each side, and then lifted
off the corselet and greaves. As he did so, great
was his astonishment to see lying before him a
maiden in soft flowing garments.</p>

<p>He started back. His heart beat wildly. This
must be none other than the maiden Brunhilda!
Then he who had never known fear—who laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in the face of the terrible dragon—quailed not before
Wotan the mighty god, and dashed fearlessly
through fire—sank down trembling and afraid before
the sleeping maiden.</p>

<p>“What is this feeling? Can <em>this</em> be Fear?” he
cried.</p>

<p>“Awake! awake, O beautiful maid!” he cried,
kneeling at her side.</p>

<p>Still she did not stir.</p>

<p>Bending over Brunhilda, Siegfried pressed his
lips to hers.</p>

<p>Slowly she opened her eyes. Siegfried started
back. She sat up dazed and wondering. Then
her eyes rested on him. For a moment neither
moved. But the silence between them said more
than words, and though only a few brief instants
went by, much happened in the time. For Siegfried
passed from boyhood to manhood, and Brunhilda
passed from the land of dreams and shadows
back to the warm living earth.</p>

<p>At last she spoke. “Hail, thou sunshine, and
light, and lovely daytime! Long has been my
sleep!” Then, fixing shining eyes on Siegfried,
“And who art <em>thou</em>,” she asked, “who hast awakened
me out of my sleep?”</p>

<p>“I am Siegfried. Through the flames I won my
way to thee. My sword it has cut through thy
armor, O most glorious maiden!”</p>

<p>Brunhilda gazed at him in wonder and delight.
“Siegfried! So thou art indeed Siegfried who hast
awakened me? Siegfried, of whom in times long
past I dreamed! My sun art thou, awakening me
out of night and darkness!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>These words made Siegfried happier than ever.
Never had his highest hopes or wildest dreams pictured
one so fair and noble as this goddess-maid.
For her sake what would he not do or dare?</p>

<p>But Brunhilda was now gazing sadly at her cast-off
armor and shield on the ground. Slowly the
words of her father’s curse were coming back to
her. Never more to ride free through the heavens—to
be a mortal woman wedded to a mortal man!</p>

<p>Gently and sadly she pushed Siegfried from her
side, and tried to turn his thoughts from herself.
“See there my faithful steed,” she said, pointing to
Grani. “He also has been awakened by Siegfried
the sun-god. Once he bore me through the heavens,
and shared my life among the gods of Valhalla.
With me also he slept. See how joyfully he has
come back to life!”</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried Brunhilda, growing ever more
melancholy. “Siegfried my hero, it is through you
I forfeit my glorious estate! Brunhilda the Valkyrie
is no more—she is dead indeed.”</p>

<p>Siegfried saw that a harder task yet remained to
him than dashing through fire or cutting through
steel, but he went on undaunted, for he felt his
new-found love strong and great enough to carry
him through all difficulties.</p>

<p>“Thou sleepest still, my beloved. I have but
opened thy glorious eyes. Oh, wake, and rejoice
that thou livest.”</p>

<p>So spake Siegfried, and his passionate pleading
turned at last, as a magic key, the locked door of
Brunhilda’s proud heart, which to no god or man
had yielded before. She turned to him and as Siegfried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
clasped her to his heart, Brunhilda renounced
for ever all she had counted most dear—all longings
for the old free Valkyrie life, all dreams of
bygone glory with the gods in Valhalla.</p>

<p>Now that her heart was won, Brunhilda gave
it all, once and for ever; and a great and noble gift
it was, worth any hero’s winning, at any cost.</p>

<h2 id="THE_PLOT_AGAINST_THE_BEAUTIFUL">THE PLOT AGAINST THE BEAUTIFUL
ELSA OF BRABANT</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time there lived, in the ancient
city of Antwerp, a beautiful maiden called Elsa.</p>

<p>She dwelt in a grand old palace: the walls were
thick as any fortress, and the towers looked proudly
down on the town.</p>

<p>Elsa’s father was the Duke of Brabant, a noble
prince, who for long years had faithfully served his
liege lord, the King of Germany, and had won
much honor to Brabant.</p>

<p>Elsa had an only brother, the young Prince
Godfrey; and these two loved each other more than
any other brother and sister in the world.</p>

<p>One day the duke was taken ill, so ill that he
could no longer attend to the affairs of state; and
a few days later all Brabant knew that their beloved
duke lay dying.</p>

<p>As their mother had been dead many years, and
they had no near relatives, the duke then sent for
his kinsman, Count Telramund. This man was
imperious and hot-tempered, with manners uncouth
as a bear; but he was brave as a lion, and the
duke had full confidence in his good heart and
knightly honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The count hastened to obey the royal summons.</p>

<p>“My trusted friend and kinsman, Frederick of
Telramund,” said the duke, “I am dying. With
my last breath I confide to thy care my beloved
children, Elsa and Godfrey. Watch over them,
protect them from all ill till Godfrey be of an age
to reign, and Elsa is married to a husband she loves.
Until then, I appoint thee as Regent and Protector
in Brabant.”</p>

<p>Count Telramund knelt by the side of the dying
duke, and swore solemnly to fulfil the trust, and,
if needs be, to lay down his life for the young
prince and princess.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” murmured the duke. “And
now, my cousin, is there aught that I can do for
thee, in return for so great a service?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, most noble prince, there is one boon I would
ask, were it not so great a gift I scarce dare even
to name it!” answered the count.</p>

<p>“Whatever thy wish, cousin, it is granted, if it
be in my power to bestow it,” said the duke readily.
“What is thy request?”</p>

<p>“Most gracious sovereign,” stammered the count,
growing red to the roots of his tawny beard, “I
love the Princess Elsa—wilt thou give her to me to
be my wife?”</p>

<p>Elsa started. Without stirring, and her face
deadly pale, she listened breathlessly for her
father’s reply.</p>

<p>“Gladly would I give my child to thy safe keeping,
noble cousin. But in this matter I must leave
the maiden free to choose for herself. If she accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thy hand, thou hast my full consent and blessing.
More than this I cannot say.”</p>

<p>The count knelt and pressed his lips to the hand
of the dying duke, who, blessing Telramund, sank
back exhausted and bade him farewell.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the good prince died, at peace with
all.</p>

<p>Elsa, heartbroken at her father’s death, found
her only consolation in her young brother Godfrey.
For a long time she refused to see anyone else.</p>

<p>Count Telramund often sought opportunity to
speak with her, but she avoided him with dread.</p>

<p>Then Telramund changed his tone, and demanded
her hand as his right, the dying bequest
of her father the duke.</p>

<p>“My father left me free,” answered Elsa, indignant.
“Never would he wish me to give my
hand where I could not give my heart also, sir
count.”</p>

<p>No woman, and very few men, had ever dared
to contradict his wishes; sooner or later, he vowed,
she should be his.</p>

<p>Now there was a wicked lady, of a tall, commanding
figure, dark and handsome—Ortruda by
name. She was very learned, and had studied all
manner of sorceries, which enabled her to exert the
magic power of a witch. Her forefathers had once
been mighty princes, who reigned over Brabant
and all the countries round. She regarded Elsa
and Godfrey as usurpers, holding what rightfully
belonged to her; and she hated them with a bitter
hatred. Also, there was another and a deeper
cause for her hatred towards Elsa; and that was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that she herself had long wished to marry Count
Telramund.</p>

<p>One day Telramund came to Ortruda and told
her how Elsa had dared to despise his love, and
reject his hand. That he should confide in her
pleased Ortruda well; also that Elsa should refuse
the count, though she loved her none the more for
doing so.</p>

<p>“The impertinent minx, to take on such airs!”</p>

<p>Telramund found comfort in Ortruda’s indignation.
His heart was set on marrying Elsa, and he
was willing to wait long if only he might win her
in the end.</p>

<p>When Ortruda saw this, she laid a deep plot, by
means of which she hoped to turn his love from
Elsa. In the depths of the forest was a lonely
tower. Here Ortruda was wont to retire and study
sorcery, for long days and nights together. She
became at last so practiced, that she could by enchantments
change people into different birds and
beasts.</p>

<p>One day, Elsa and Godfrey were roaming together
alone in the forest. Ortruda, always on the
watch, followed them, unseen, at a distance. After
a while they sat down to rest by the side of a pool,
whose still depths, it was said, no one had ever
fathomed.</p>

<p>Presently, Elsa and Godfrey were startled by
hearing a piercing, pitiful cry, like that of some
animal caught in a trap. Godfrey started up, crying:
“I must go and free that poor beast! Rest
here a while, Elsa; I will return shortly.”</p>

<p>He sprang lightly through the thickly growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
bushes and trees, and was soon hidden from
sight.</p>

<p>Elsa waited by the pool, thinking of all the
happy plans she and Godfrey had been making
for the future, when he would reign as duke. The
trees overhead rustled strangely, and Elsa, looking
up, saw a great white swan circling round, and
waving his wings wildly as though in distress. Then
with a sad cry, he flew away.</p>

<p>Elsa grew uneasy. Surely an hour must have
passed, yet Godfrey had not returned! She called
aloud: “Godfrey! Godfrey! where art thou?” But
there was no answer save the echo of her own voice,
which rang through the wood as though mocking
her anxious cry.</p>

<p>Then, in deadly fear, she started up and tried to
trace his steps, but the dense thicket left no track.
Pale and trembling, Elsa returned at last to the
palace, and told how Godfrey had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>That night the forest was searched from end to
end with torches and lanterns, and all the following
day the search continued, but not a trace of the
missing boy could be found.</p>

<p>Two days after Godfrey’s disappearance, Ortruda
came to Telramund. She appeared in deep
distress, saying she had something to reveal, and
dared no longer keep silence. “Alas!” replied Ortruda,
“what I know is well-nigh too terrible to
be spoken. Who will credit my dark tale? Listen,”
she continued; “thy search for Godfrey is useless.”</p>

<p>“Two days ago I sat alone meditating in my
tower in the forest, when I espied Elsa and Godfrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
sitting together by the pool—that awful pool where,
’tis said, a drowning man may sink for a thousand
years, yet never touch the bottom. On a sudden I
heard a cry, and looking, saw Elsa, aided by a
stranger, whose face was turned to me, push her
young brother backward into the dread pool.”</p>

<p>“Horrible! most horrible!” cried Telramund.
“Thou sawest this with thine own eyes?”</p>

<p>“I saw it with these same eyes, that will I swear,
though it were with my last breath!” replied Ortruda.</p>

<p>“Who could dream that such black sin dwelt in
one so young and fair!”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Ortruda, eyeing him askance; “and
knowing that thou lovedst her, I would have kept
silence. But when thine enemies whispered that
thou, being next of kin, might thyself have caused
the lad’s disappearance, then my love for thee made
me bold to speak the dread secret.”</p>

<p>“I thank thee, Ortruda. Thou hast ever shown
thyself my faithful friend,” said Telramund. “It
were better had I given my love to thee, instead
of wasting it on one so unworthy.”</p>

<p>“My father’s house once ruled in this land, and,
in justice, should be ruling still. Ah! were poor
Ortruda queen, with what joy would she lay her
kingdom at thy feet, noblest and bravest of men!”</p>

<p>“Thou art worthy to be a queen!” cried Telramund,
“and that shalt thou be, noble and wise
Ortruda! For here do I swear to make thee my
wife, instead of her in whom I have been so woefully
deceived. As for the murderess, her cruel
deed shall be brought to light. She shall be tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
by our king, Henry of Germany, and both she and
her base lover will assuredly be condemned to
death.”</p>

<p>In obedience to Telramund’s orders, Elsa was
then put under arrest, and placed in a dark prison-cell,
to await her trial before the king. She was
kept a close prisoner, no one save the followers
of Telramund and Ortruda being allowed to come
near her. In her grief and despair she knelt one
night and prayed, one long bitter cry for help. And
all at once her prayer seemed taken up, as though
on angels’ wings; above the narrow prison-cell—up,
up, till it pierced the utmost heights of the sky
above. Elsa listened till she heard the faint echo
fade away far overhead. And, as she wondered
what it might mean, a gentle sleep closed her eyes.
She dreamt; and in her dream she saw a noble
knight in shining silver armor. Swiftly through
the air he came, and, descending to her prison-cell,
stood by her side. No word did he speak, but with
looks and signs he bade her banish all fear and sorrow,
and trust in him, for he was sent by Heaven
in answer to her cry.</p>

<p>When Elsa woke, the bitterness of her grief had
passed. The vision had departed, but she felt
assured her prayer was heard, and that, sooner or
later, the Heaven-sent knight of her dream would
come and bring her deliverance.</p>

<h2 id="THE_KNIGHTS_OF_THE_HOLY_GRAIL">THE KNIGHTS OF THE HOLY GRAIL</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">Far away, in the mountains of Spain, there
dwelt a holy band of knights, vowed to the
service of all those in distress or need.</p>

<p>The famous Knight Parsifal was at this time
king of the Order, and under his reign the Knights
of the Holy Grail were unsurpassed for valor
and truth. When any cry of distress went up to
Heaven, the great bells of the Grail temple would
commence to swing slowly to and fro, and at this
sign the knights assembled in their temple, whatever
the hour, day or night: there the Holy Grail
would reveal to them, in letters of fire, what service
was required.</p>

<p>The same night on which Elsa knelt in her
prison-cell, far away in Antwerp, the mighty bells
of Mount Salvat suddenly broke the stillness of
the peaceful night. With Parsifal at their head,
the brothers of the Holy Grail hastened to the
temple. Among them was one Lohengrin, a young
knight of most noble fame, son of Parsifal, the king.</p>

<p>Round the altar knelt the knights; while the
king mounted the steps and took from a golden
shrine the miraculous crystal Cup, known as the
Holy Grail. A dazzling ray of light instantly
streamed down from the dome above the altar,
lighting up the Cup, which then began to glow
with letters of fire written round the brim. Parsifal
held the Cup aloft, that all might read the
message: “There is one falsely accused, in sore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
need and trouble—the Princess Elsa of Brabant.”
So ran the writing on the Holy Grail. The glowing
letters slowly faded and vanished.</p>

<p>But while the knights discussed among themselves
which of them should at once depart for
Brabant, the Cup again glowed with another message:
“Let Lohengrin, the son of Parsifal, make
ready and depart. He it is, appointed to be her
champion.”</p>

<p>Lohengrin rejoiced greatly at being chosen.
Kneeling before his father, he craved a blessing
before setting out on his journey. Then, buckling
on his armor and his sword, a golden horn slung
round his neck, he mounted his black charger, and
rode off into the silent forest.</p>

<p>On he rode. The tall, dark pine trees met over
his head; the silver moon peeped between the
branches, lighting him on his way. All the forest
slept. At length he came to the river which marked
the boundary of the Grail dominions. He was
about to ford the stream, when, to his amazement,
he beheld a boat, drawn by a snow-white swan,
evidently awaiting him.</p>

<p>Lohengrin dismounted, and recognized the swan
as a bird which had not long since appeared among
them, and taken up his abode with the knights. As
a white swan had always been held in good omen
by the knights, the bird received a hearty welcome.
And the more so when, shortly after his arrival, the
Grail revealed that the bird was none other than
a youth of noble birth, the innocent victim of a
wicked enchantment. Round the swan’s neck was
a fine gold chain of curious workmanship, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
neither clasp nor fastening, so that no man could
remove it without injury to the bird. From the day
he appeared, the swan attached himself specially
to Lohengrin. He would follow him about like a
dog, and often gazed into his face as though he
longed to speak with him.</p>

<p>Seeing this faithful bird awaiting him, Lohengrin
asked him: “Wilt thou that I go with thee, dear
swan?” The bird instantly bent his graceful head,
and spread wide his white wings, as though impatient
to start. Lohengrin then dismissed his
horse, bidding him return to Mount Salvat, stepped
into the boat, and the swan sailed away joyfully
with him. Down the river they floated swiftly.
The swan seemed quite sure of his way. Even
when they came at last to the sea, he never paused,
but steered a steady course right out of the bay,
and away across the wide ocean.</p>

<h2 id="LOHENGRIN_THE_CHAMPION_OF">LOHENGRIN THE CHAMPION OF
ELSA OF BRABANT</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the city of Antwerp great preparations were
going forward.</p>

<p>King Henry of Germany had arrived in state,
and had summoned all the ministers and chief
nobles of Brabant to appear before him.</p>

<p>Elsa, in her prison-cell, was wakened early with
the news that she would be tried this day before the
king, in face of all the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>She heard as though it scarce concerned her.
Since the vision of the knight in shining armor, she
no longer seemed to dwell in the dark prison. Her
thoughts were far away, and she cared nothing for
what took place around her.</p>

<p>It was noon when the king, with his heralds, outriders,
and a numerous retinue, proceeded in solemn
state to the Judgment Oak. Mid the cheers and
blessings of the people, he ascended a gorgeous
throne prepared for him.</p>

<p>Count Telramund bowed low before the king.
Then, in a clear ringing voice, told his story, and
made his accusation against Elsa, Princess of
Brabant, of whose horrible crime he said he had,
alas, convincing proof. He then claimed the kingdom
of Brabant for himself, as next of kin to the
late duke, and also in right of his noble wife Ortruda,
whose fathers once ruled in that land.</p>

<p>“Now, O most noble king, thou hast heard me
fully,” he concluded. “Naught have I spoken but
the truth—my oath upon it. Be thou our judge.”</p>

<p>The crowd shuddered with horror at the story of
Elsa’s crime. Their own princess, so gentle and
fair, the cruel murderess of her brother! Impossible!
Yet who dare dispute it, since Count Telramund,
whose honor no man could doubt, himself
swore to the fact.</p>

<p>“What terrible accusation dost thou bring? Bid
the accused appear!” cried the king. “The trial
shall forthwith begin.”</p>

<p>The herald blew his trumpet, and proclaimed the
king’s order. There was a stir in the crowd. All
eyes turned towards her as Elsa appeared, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by her ladies. Slowly she walked to the foot of the
throne, gazing before her like one in a dream.</p>

<p>“Art thou Elsa of Brabant?” asked the king.
Elsa bowed her head.</p>

<p>“Dost thou know the charge that is brought
against thee?” he demanded sternly.</p>

<p>Again Elsa assented, dropping her head sadly,
but without speaking.</p>

<p>“What answer canst thou make? Dost admit
thy guilt?” the king inquired.</p>

<p>She gazed around her with a bewildered air, as
though trying to remember something long forgotten.</p>

<p>“Alas,” she sighed, “my poor brother!”</p>

<p>The people murmured: “’Tis marvellous! What
can it mean?”</p>

<p>“Speak, Elsa!” urged the king, wondering at
her strange behavior. “Dost thou not trust in thy
king?”</p>

<p>Then Elsa spoke in a low gentle voice, as to herself
when alone in the prison: “In my misery I
knelt one night and besought God’s aid. My woeful
cry seemed all at once caught up to the highest
heaven. I listened wondering, then peace fell on
my spirit, and a gentle sleep came over me.”</p>

<p>The King thought Elsa’s mind was certainly
affected, whether from brooding on her crime, or
on her innocence and the injustice of her imprisonment,
he could not tell. “Come, Elsa,” he said,
in a rousing tone, “defend thyself now before the
judge.”</p>

<p>But Elsa appeared neither to hear nor understand,
and continued her dream with a look of rapture:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“Borne through the air he came—a knight of
such perfection and nobility never yet I saw!
Clothed in glittering armor—in his hand a sword—slung
round his neck a golden horn! No word he
spake, but gazed on me tenderly. Peace and comfort
came to me with his look. That knight will be
my champion and deliverer!”</p>

<p>The king was sorely perplexed. This dreamy
maiden hardly seemed like a criminal. Looking at
the sad, fair face of the prisoner, he could not find
it in his heart to believe her guilty. Yet he held
the count, as a true and honorable knight, incapable
of falsehood; one who had, besides, risked his
life for king and country.</p>

<p>Turning to the count, he then asked solemnly:
“Frederick of Telramund, wilt thou in mortal combat
let Heaven’s ordeal decide thine accusation as
true or false?”</p>

<p>“Yea, that will I, O king,” answered Telramund,
with proud confidence.</p>

<p>“And thee also, I ask, Elsa of Brabant, wilt thou
abide by Heaven’s decree in the mortal combat that
shall be fought for thy cause?”</p>

<p>Elsa’s eyes were fixed on the far distance. “Yea,
that will I,” she replied slowly.</p>

<p>“What champion shall defend thee?” asked the
king.</p>

<p>“That knight whom Heaven sent me! He and
none other shall be my champion,” replied Elsa.
“And this is the reward I offer. He shall wear my
father’s crown, and high honor I shall deem it to
give to him my land, my wealth, and my hand.”</p>

<p>“A prize worth fighting for!” murmured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
people. Their hearts beat true to their princess,
in spite of appearances against her.</p>

<p>“Let the summons go forth!” cried the king.</p>

<p>The heralds and trumpeters then marched to the
outposts and proclaimed the challenge, so that all
might hear it, far and near: “Let him who will
fight in mortal combat for Elsa of Brabant now
appear!” There was a long pause, and breathless
silence followed. The echo of the trumpet’s
blast died away into the distance. But no one
appeared in answer to the call. Elsa listened,
looking round on all sides, with anxious, expectant
gaze. “O gracious king,” implored Elsa, “I beseech
thee let the call go forth once again to
summon my knight. He dwells so far he has not
heard.”</p>

<p>“Let the summons go forth yet once more,” he
ordered. Again the heralds proclaimed the challenge.</p>

<p>There followed a longer pause and a longer
silence. No one stirred. The people scarcely
seemed to breathe, so great was the suspense and
expectation.</p>

<p>Elsa fell on her knees, while her maidens closed
round as though to protect her. “O Lord,” she
cried, “send my knight speedily, I beseech thee.
Once, at Thy command, he came to me. Oh, send
him now again. Tell him of my sore need,” she
implored in despair. Her women knelt also, weeping
and praying.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry went up from the people standing
near the river-bank: “See! A wondrous sight!
A swan! a swan drawing a boat! And, standing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the prow, behold a knight in shining armor. Lo,
he comes with utmost speed!” All rushed forward
eagerly to see.</p>

<p>The king from his throne looked towards the
river and beheld the amazing sight. Elsa, on her
knees, listened spellbound, in a transport of joy.
Frederick of Telramund, struck dumb with awe
and astonishment, looked at Ortruda. Her face
had turned to an ashen hue. Her glittering eyes
were dull, as though the light within had suddenly
gone out. She gazed at the swan with greater
terror than had he been a dragon.</p>

<p>“’Tis a miracle! A miracle of Heaven!” exclaimed
the men.</p>

<p>The women, on their knees, cried joyfully: “Oh,
God be thanked, who hast heard our prayer! Hail
to the Heaven-sent one who comes to save the
guiltless!”</p>

<p>The boat had now reached the bank. Lohengrin
stepped lightly to land, and then turned lovingly
to the swan: “My thanks to thee, beloved swan,”
he said. “Return now o’er the waters to the blessed
land from whence we came. Faithfully hast thou
fulfilled thy task. Farewell, beloved swan.”</p>

<p>He gazed sadly after his faithful companion, as
the swan slowly turned and swam away.</p>

<p>The crowd made way for him eagerly, as Lohengrin
advanced to the king’s throne and bowed low.
As he raised his head, Elsa turned, and uttered a
cry of joy at beholding no other than the knight of
her vision.</p>

<p>“Hail, royal Henry! May the blessing of
Heaven ever rest on thee!” said Lohengrin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Welcome, sir knight!” replied the king graciously.
“Surely by a miracle divine thou art
come to this land?”</p>

<p>“I have been sent, O king, to fight for the honor
of an innocent maiden, in sore need and distress,”
answered Lohengrin. Then, going before Elsa, he
asked her: “Wilt thou trust thy cause to me, O
Elsa of Brabant? Wilt thou take me for thy champion
without doubt or fear?”</p>

<p>Elsa raised her eyes to his. “My deliverer, my
knight—with my whole heart do I trust thee!” she
answered. Lohengrin knelt and, taking her hand in
his, asked: “And if, with Heaven’s help, I win this
fight for thee, wilt thou consent to be my bride?”</p>

<p>“I am thine—thine only, my knight. All I have
I give thee gladly!” said Elsa, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“One promise wilt thou give me?”</p>

<p>“To thee will I promise anything,” Elsa answered
readily.</p>

<p>“Then if thou desirest, as I, that nothing part us
ever—that thy people and thy country become
from henceforth my people and my country—never
shalt thou ask of me my name and race, or
whence I come,” said Lohengrin earnestly.</p>

<p>“Never will I seek to know thy secret. Thy
love is enough for me—naught else do I desire!”</p>

<p>“But Elsa, think well what it is I ask,” urged
Lohengrin. “Never must thou desire this knowledge,
and never must this secret between us cause
thee sadness.”</p>

<p>Elsa was troubled that Lohengrin repeated his
request. There was nothing in the world she would
not gladly grant to him—her champion, her deliverer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
“Thou hast never doubted my innocence,”
she answered. “Dost thou not trust in me? And
shall not I also trust in thee, my knight, whate’er
thou askest of me?”</p>

<p>Then Lohengrin stood forth, and, in a ringing
voice that all might hear, proclaimed: “Hear now,
all ye people, and ye nobles of Brabant! I hereby
declare, before Heaven and before all men, by my
honor as a knight, that free from every shadow of
guilt is the maiden Elsa, Princess of Brabant.
False and unfounded is thy black charge, Frederick
of Telramund, and that will I prove by Heaven’s
ordeal!”</p>

<p>Telramund advanced with angry mien and flashing
eyes: “What magic brought thee here, sir
stranger, I know not. Thy talk is bold enough!
But my answer is not in words. This, my good
sword, shall defend mine honor. May victory be
to right and truth, say I!”</p>

<p>Lohengrin turned towards the throne: “We await
thy command, O king, to commence the combat.”</p>

<p>The king ordered the fighting-ring to be
measured; and this being done, he then besought
Heaven that in this fight victory might be, not as
in other fights, to skill and strength, but to the one
on whose side was right. And all the people fervently
echoed the good king’s prayer.</p>

<p>Scarce a breath could be heard. Every eye was
fixed on the gleaming swords, as they cut the air
like flashes of lightning, and clashed with sharp,
ringing strokes.</p>

<p>A few intense moments, which seemed to Elsa’s
beating heart a very eternity; then a crash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
falling armor, a wild shout from the people, and
the fight was over.</p>

<p>Telramund had fallen; over him, like an angel
of judgment, stood Lohengrin. “Through Heaven’s
victory, thy life is mine!” he cried. “I give it
thee again, that thou mayest use it for repentance.”</p>

<p>“Victory, victory! Hail to the hero!” shouted
a thousand glad voices.</p>

<p>“The victory I owe to thy innocence alone,” said
Lohengrin to Elsa. “All that thou hast suffered
shall now be atoned to thee.” Then Lohengrin and
Elsa were lifted on the shields of the nobles, and all
the people marched round them in a triumphal procession,
shouting a hymn of joyful thanksgiving, in
which the good King Henry himself joined lustily.</p>

<p>Only Ortruda and the defeated Telramund stood
sullenly apart. “Woe is me! Mine honor and
fame are undone,” muttered the count. “It would
seem indeed that Heaven is against me.”</p>

<p>Ortruda, with clenched hands, asked herself in
dismay: “Who can this be? Before whom even I
feel my powers weaken! Who? and from whence?”</p>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">The stars came out in the deep blue sky of
night, waiting for the summer moon.</p>

<p>The stately walls of the royal palace of Antwerp
threw mysterious shadows all around. And in the
darkness of these shadows crept two figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
stealthily. They seated themselves at length under
a tree which faced the windows of the Princess
Elsa’s apartments.</p>

<p>Looking up, they saw a light still burning.</p>

<p>Then they talked together earnestly in muffled
tones.</p>

<p>By and by the moon arose, and cast her silvery
light about, shifting the shadows according to her
royal pleasure.</p>

<p>The two dark figures, a man and a woman,
moved with the shadows, still keeping close to the
palace. They took no thought of rest or sleep
that night.</p>

<p>The man looked at the woman, and shuddered.</p>

<p>The woman turned to the man, a scornful light in
her eyes. She was for action, and despised useless
regrets and groans.</p>

<p>“Frederick of Telramund, why dost thou mistrust
me?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Why?” he cried wrathfully. “Was it not on
thy false word that I accused the guiltless, and
condemned an innocent maid? Thou who didst
swear that thine own eyes beheld her murder the
youthful Godfrey!”</p>

<p>“Dost thou know who is this mysterious hero,
drawn hither across the sea by a wild swan?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Nay, I know not,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Hearken now to me,” said Ortruda. “It is forbidden
him to reveal either his name or country.
That, his own words allowed. The reason I will
tell thee. Should he do so, all his magic power
instantly vanishes. There is but one person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
can tear his secret from him—she whom he so
strictly forbade to ask him.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Elsa! She must be made to do this!” cried
Telramund eagerly. Ortruda looked at him and
smiled. Her smile was very terrible. “If thou
wilt be but silent and watchful, thou shalt taste
the sweets of revenge. But—hist!”</p>

<p>The window opposite opened softly. Ortruda
and Telramund drew back farther into the shadow.
A white-robed figure came out on the balcony.</p>

<p>Ortruda whispered in Telramund’s ear: “Go
thou, and leave her alone with me,” and Frederick
withdrew.</p>

<p>“Elsa!” cried a wailing, miserable voice.</p>

<p>Elsa started. “Who calls me?”</p>

<p>“Is my voice so strange to thee?” answered Ortruda
piteously. “Wilt thou repulse one in sore
distress?”</p>

<p>“Ortruda! Thou! What doest thou here, and at
this hour, unhappy woman?” asked Elsa, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ah, woe is me!” moaned Ortruda. “What have
I done, that such dark trouble should fall on me?
How different thy fate! After a brief time of
trouble, every cloud has vanished, and life smiles
gloriously before thee.”</p>

<p>“Most unworthy should I be of my great happiness,
could I spurn one in misery such as thine, Ortruda.
Come! I myself will open the door to you.”</p>

<p>“Ortruda, where art thou?” called the gentle
voice of Elsa, opening the door.</p>

<p>“Here at thy feet!” replied Ortruda, throwing
herself down before the white-robed figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kneel not to me, I beseech thee, Ortruda,” cried
Elsa, much distressed. “Thou, whom I have
always beheld in pride and magnificence! Freely I
forgive thee. And if in aught thou hast suffered
through my fault, I pray thee pardon me in like
manner.”</p>

<p>“How can I thank thee for such gracious favor?”
returned Ortruda, in tones of great humility. “And
for thy husband Telramund,” continued Elsa, “I
will beseech my noble bridegroom on the morrow,
that he show him grace and pardon. So let me see
thee once more restored to happiness. Arrayed in
thy robe of state, come thou with me to the minister,
where our marriage will to-morrow be celebrated
before God and all men.”</p>

<p>“Thou loadest me with chains of gratitude,” said
Ortruda. “Only one way is there in which I may
perhaps repay thee—by my knowledge of the
hidden arts I may be able to protect thy life, and
warn thee should grave danger arise.”</p>

<p>“What meanest thou?” asked Elsa, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Trust not thy happiness too blindly,” replied
Ortruda darkly, “lest some evil entrap thee unawares.”
Ortruda drew closer, and lowered her
voice: “Dost know by what magic art <em>he</em> came to
thee?”</p>

<h2 id="THE_DEPARTURE_OF_LOHENGRIN">THE DEPARTURE OF LOHENGRIN</h2>

<p class="author">By Constance Maud</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was Princess Elsa’s wedding-day.</p>

<p>The sober old city of Antwerp had blossomed
out in colors gay as a spring garden, with banners,
ribbons, garlands of flowers, and triumphal arches.</p>

<p>Not a burgher or a prentice but kept holiday.</p>

<p>Royal weddings were not an everyday sight,
more especially when the bride was a princess of
such beauty and virtue, and the bridegroom a
knight who had risked his life for her sake.</p>

<p>Every maid in Antwerp would gladly have gone
through fire and water just for a sight of the knight
in silver armor. Greatly were those envied who
had seen him arrive, drawn by the snow-white
swan.</p>

<p>The bells of the old cathedral rang out a joyful
chime. From every quarter came a stream of
people, all hurrying to secure the best places from
which to see the bridal procession. Guarding the
entrance of the cathedral, on either side, were
stationed knights and nobles in full court dress,
ablaze with medals and decorations, helmets and
waving plumes.</p>

<p>“She comes! She comes! Make way for the
bride,” sang a chorus of voices. And Elsa appeared,
more beautiful than a spring morning. Little children,
clad in white, strewed her path with flowers.
Maidens of high degree followed, bearing her bridal
train. Never had a fairer, happier maid passed
through the ancient doorway to become a bride.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;" id="illus5">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Smiling and bowing graciously, Elsa ascended
the cathedral steps, when suddenly her way was
barred by a tall commanding figure, who pushed
through the astonished crowd and stood before her.
It was Ortruda.</p>

<p>“Back, I say!” she cried wrathfully. “Thinkest
thou that I am going to follow thee, like a serving-maid!
No longer will I suffer it! The time has
come when thou shalt bow before me!”</p>

<p>The attendants and courtiers stood aghast. “The
woman must be mad!” they exclaimed to one
another.</p>

<p>Elsa could scarce believe that this was the same
Ortruda who, a few hours before, had knelt in the
dust at her feet.</p>

<p>Pale and trembling she cried:</p>

<p>“Ortruda! Is it possible? What has happened
to change thee thus terribly?”</p>

<p>Ortruda gave a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>“Thinkest thou,” she answered, “that because I
foolishly forgot my high position and my worth for
one short hour, I must forever after approach thee
crawling? My lord was first in all the land! Not
a foe but feared his sword, not a tongue but spake
his praise. But thy hero! No man ever heard of
him! Thou thyself canst not even give him a
name.”</p>

<p>The people murmured indignantly:</p>

<p>“Will no man silence this slanderous woman?”</p>

<p>But all trembled, remembering her reputation as
a witch, and not daring to brave her wrath.</p>

<p>Fortunately at this moment appeared the king’s
outriders, followed by the royal bodyguard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
King Henry himself, riding side by side with the
bridegroom.</p>

<p>“What! Ho!” cried the king, looking at the
threatening figure standing across the bride’s
path. “Who dares to make strife on a wedding
morn?”</p>

<p>Lohengrin hastened to Elsa’s side. “What do
I see? Why is this terrible woman near thee?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, my deliverer, protect me from her! Pardon
me, that I forgot thy warning. Seeing her in
misery at my door last night, I took her in. Behold
now how she turns on me, and mocks me for my
trust in thee!”</p>

<p>Lohengrin stood between Ortruda and the
trembling Elsa. “Begone, thou fearful woman!”
he cried. “Carry elsewhere thy poison. Here is
no soil in which it can take root.”</p>

<p>“Hold there!” cried a loud harsh voice. “O king,
hearken, I pray. Greatly hast thou been deceived.
The combat was no Heaven’s ordeal, for, by the
evil power of magic, justice was turned aside.
Here, before all men, I challenge him, the impostor,
to declare his name and race, and from where
he came, drawn hither by that unholy bird. If he
dare not say, methinks it looks bad for his knightly
truth and honor! I appeal to thee, illustrious
prince! Demand thou a reply from this unknown
hero. He will scarcely dare to call thee unworthy
of his answer.”</p>

<p>Lohengrin confronted the wrathful Telramund:
“All honor would I ever show to his most illustrious
majesty; but there is one only to whom I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
bound to reveal my secret—that one is Elsa, my
bride.”</p>

<p>Lohengrin feared for one dread moment that the
wicked Ortruda’s poison had, after all, begun to
work. One moment only; then, to his joy, Elsa
raised her head, and shaking off all doubt, she
cried: “What he keeps secret, that he does in
wisdom. She whom he has saved, shall she not
trust him?”</p>

<p>And the king added heartily: “My hero, pay no
regard to evil-speakers. Thou art too far above
them for such to tarnish thy spotless fame.”</p>

<p>The nobles then pressed round Lohengrin, assuring
him of their trust and devotion, even though he
should never see fit to reveal his name; and the wedding
procession entered the cathedral in solemn
state.</p>

<p>When the wedding-feast was over and the
wedding-guests had gone, Elsa and Lohengrin sat
at the window, looking out on the starlit night.</p>

<p>Elsa sighed. A tiny cloud crept over her heart
at the thought that she knew no name by which to
call her love.</p>

<p>Lohengrin noticed it and strove to turn her
thoughts from the dangerous subject. But Elsa
continued, as though forced to return to it: “Ah
show thou thinkest me worthy of thy trust! Now
that we are alone, tell me thy secret and let it be
buried in my heart, safe, where never the world can
reach it.”</p>

<p>“Have I not shown thee highest trust?” answered
Lohengrin. “I have trusted in thy promise. Now
my greatest joy is in thy love. It is the only reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
I ask for all I have left behind. For not out of
night and sorrow did I come to thee, but out of
light and glory.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried Elsa. “Then art thou farther
removed, and I yet more unworthy, than e’er I
dreamt! Any day may rob me of thee! Ere long
thou wilt surely regret thy humble choice, and long
after thy departed glory.” Tears blinded her eyes.
Lohengrin saw, too late, that what he had told her
but increased her doubt and unhappiness. She
longed now more than ever to be trusted with his
secret.</p>

<p>“The fear lest thou depart will haunt me day
and night! Who is this unknown one? Whence
comes he?” No peace now for Elsa, day or night,
until she can answer.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she cried, “it was by a miracle thou
camest here! Thy path is hidden, like thyself, in
mystery. Thy life is divided from mine by a cloud.”</p>

<p>“Ah, look!” she cried, clutching wildly Lohengrin’s
arm. “See the swan? He comes! There—down
the river! He brings the boat! Thou hast
called him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elsa, cease this madness!” cried Lohengrin,
in despair.</p>

<p>“Nothing can give me peace again, till I know—even
though it cost me my life—who thou art, and
whence thou comest.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” groaned Lohengrin, covering his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>So absorbed were they both, that they did not
hear the stealthy tread upon the stair, nor the low,
muffled voices outside the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was a crash. The door was
broken open, and a group of dark figures, cloaked
and masked, barred the passage, while one of the
number rushed towards Lohengrin, drawing his
naked sword.</p>

<p>It was the work of an instant. Lohengrin had
but time to seize his sword, when the stalwart
figure closed with him.</p>

<p>In the flickering torchlight, he parried the foe’s
first deadly thrust, and before he had time for a
second, the trusty sword of Lohengrin had pierced
to his traitorous heart. With a deep groan he fell
back, and Elsa beheld, as she suspected, the face of
Frederick of Telramund.</p>

<p>Hearing the noise, Elsa’s attendants and guards
now crowded into the room. The dark masked
figures had fled on seeing their master fall.</p>

<p>Lohengrin turned to the guards, and bade them
bear the body of Telramund before the king’s
judgment-seat.</p>

<p>Then to Elsa’s attendants, who supported their
fainting mistress, he said sadly: “Make her ready
to appear before the king. There I will meet her,
and answer her question—Who I am, and from
whence I come?”</p>

<p>At noon next day, King Henry held a review of
his troops.</p>

<p>Before leaving Antwerp, the king desired to collect
forces for a war against the savage Drohns, who
were threatening the peace of Germany. The king
counted greatly on Lohengrin’s help, for never had
he seen one more fitted to command and lead his
troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>But now the appointed hour had come, and still
the king waited for the arrival of the knight.</p>

<p>Presently all were startled by the appearance
of a solemn procession, bearing in their midst the
body of a dead man. “Make way!” whispered the
crowd, awestruck. “These are the followers of
Telramund.”</p>

<p>Close on them followed Elsa and her ladies.
Alas, how changed from the happy bride of yesterday!</p>

<p>“Ah, here he comes! Our hero!” cried the people,
as Lohengrin at length appeared. “Welcome,
sir knight,” said the king. “We look to
thee to lead these brave troops on to victory.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my lord the king!” answered Lohengrin,
“it is not possible for me now to lead thy soldiers,
as I hoped.”</p>

<p>“Heaven help us! What means this?” cried the
king, dismayed, not only at Lohengrin’s words,
but by his sad, solemn bearing.</p>

<p>“First, I ask thy righteous judgment, before all
the people, concerning this man.” He pointed to
the body of Telramund. “In the middle of the
night, he fell on me unawares. Was I right in
that I slew him?”</p>

<p>“Thy hand was but the instrument of a just
Heaven in so slaying him!” replied the king,
sternly regarding the dead traitor.</p>

<p>“Ye heard all how she, my bride, gave me her
promise, that never would she ask who I am or
from whence I came. Now, alas! she has broken
that promise—she has listened to traitorous counsel!
Now hear, all ye people, whether my secret is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
one to be ashamed of before king, nobles, and the
world!” Lohengrin raised his voice till it rang on
all sides like a clarion.</p>

<p>“In the distant land, far from hence, is a mountain
named Mount Salvat. In the midst stands a
temple; none on earth can compare with its magnificence.
Therein is guarded a sacred treasure,
brought thither years ago by an angel-host. It is
the Holy Grail. The knight who serves the Grail
derives divine strength from the power of its might.
Before him evil flies, and death itself is vanquished.
Even when far away in distant lands, so long as
the knight remains unknown, the Grail still renews
his strength. But the working of the Holy Grail
must ever remain veiled. Once the source of
mystery is revealed, the blessings granted must be
withdrawn—such is the Grail’s command. I was
hither sent to you by order of the Grail. My father
is Parsifal, the king—I am his warrior, Lohengrin!”</p>

<p>Elsa listened like one hearing her death-sentence.
Had not her ladies supported her, she must have
fallen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Elsa,” he cried mournfully, “why didst
thou tear my secret from me? Now, alas, we are
parted forever!”</p>

<p>“The swan! The swan!” cried a chorus of voices
near the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Elsa turned to look, and there, sailing swiftly
towards them, came the snow-white swan, drawing
the small boat in which the shining knight had
arrived.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Elsa,” he said, “the Grail has sent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
me—I dare not tarry. One year only, and I might
have had the joy of seeing thee again united to thy
long-lost brother. For he is not dead, and by the
might of the Grail he was then to be restored to
thee. Now hearken. Should he return, give him
these—my sword and horn and ring. The sword
will bring him victory in battle, the horn will bring
him help in time of need, and the ring he shall wear
in memory of me. Farewell, my beloved bride;
farewell forever!”</p>

<h2 id="THE_WOOING_OF_THE_DAUGHTER">THE WOOING OF THE DAUGHTER
OF THE KING OF IRELAND</h2>

<p class="author"><i>From the Gudrun Lay</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">When Hettel, the young King of Denmark,
but newly crowned, was minded to take him
a wife, he sent and gathered together his high vassals
and lieges to his palace in Hegelingen to give
him counsel.</p>

<p>And Morung of Nifland said to the king: “There
is one maiden that for comeliness surpasseth all
others in the world: that is Hilda, daughter of wild
Hagen, King of Ireland; and she is peerless.”</p>

<p>“That may be so,” answered the king, “but
Hagen is waxed so proud that there is no dealing
with him by fair words; and many kings and yarls
which sought to carry her off by strength of arm
now sleep the sword-sleep because of her.”</p>

<p>Then spake the sweet-voiced Horant: “Full well
I know the maiden. She is radiant as the soft new
snow beneath the dawn. Stern is her father, and
cruel as the north wind that tears the clouds and
breaks the sea, and shakes the pines in his fists.
Wherefore if the king must send a messenger, let
him not choose me.” Frute spake also: “Neither
am I fain to go upon this errand. But let the king
send and summon Yarl Wate of Sturmen; he is
more reckless than any man, and heedeth no living
thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>But when Yarl Wate was come before the king,
and understood what was required of him, he was
but ill-pleased, and said: “I ween Horant and
Frute to have counseled thee in this, and to have
done in no friendly wise toward me. Howbeit I
am not the man to pick an enterprise that hath no
peril in it. I will go. But since Horant and Frute
esteem my life so lightly, they shall go likewise.”</p>

<p>Then Yrolt of Ortland and Morung said: “It is
well spoken; and inasmuch as it behooveth none to
hang back when brave men take their lives in their
hands, we also will go with them.”</p>

<p>So the king made ready a great ship of cypress
wood, in fashion like a dragon. It was all aglow
with golden scales; the anchor was of silver, and
the steering paddle overlaid with gold. Within he
furnished it abundantly with victual for the voyage,
with armor and raiment, and presents of great
price.</p>

<p>Then Yarl Wate and Morung, Horant and
Frute and Yrolt, entered into the ship with seven
hundred of their men. They drew aloft the embroidered
sail; a fair wind arose and bore them out
of harbor. For many days they tilled the barren
sea-fields, until weary of sea toil they saw the welcome
land, and steered in for Castle Balian, where
Hagen the king kept court.</p>

<p>Being come to shore, Horant and Yrolt took
precious jewels in their hands worth many thousand
marks, and leaving their men hidden in the ship,
came to King Hagen, saying: “Behold we have
voyaged from a far country where we have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of thy fame, and we pray thee take these presents
at our hands.” Hagen looked at the jewels and
marvelled at their great worth. He said: “What
kings are ye, and whence have you come with all
this treasure.”</p>

<p>Horant answered, saying: “Banished folk are
we. Hast thou not heard of Hattel, who is king
in Hegelingen, and of his might and majesty, of
the battles he has fought and the riches he has
gathered together? He despiseth such as we, and
being well befriended careth nothing for his men.
Wherefore a few of us, weary of his overbearing
ways, have left him seeking service.” Then
said Hagen: “Ye shall abide with me”; and he
commanded to make ready lodgings for them in
the city.</p>

<p>But Horant and Yrolt gave gold away so lavishly
to all within the city that the people said,
“Of a truth these must be the richest kings of the
earth.”</p>

<p>And the fair Hilda hearing of it desired greatly
to see these strangers; wherefore her father bade
them to a feast.</p>

<p>The Danish knights came at his bidding, arrayed
most sumptuously. And the feast being
over, and the wine outpoured, the queen and Hilda
left the table, desiring that the guests might be
brought to them in the inner chamber. First Yarl
Wate went in, a huge and burly man, with a great
rough beard and brawny hands. But when the
queen bade him sit between her and the princess he
blushed and stammered, and then blundered shamefaced
to the seat. “Thou art strangely ill at ease in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
company of ladies,” said the queen. “Aye, mistress,”
said Yarl Wate, “I am not oversmooth of
tongue. I am not skilled to lisp about the weather.
What shall I say? This seat is soft enough. I
never mind me to have sat so soft before, nor to
have wrought so hard in doing it. By my life, good
ladies!” he cried upstarting, “a good day’s battle
with a brisk enemy never wearied me so much, or
made me deem myself so great a fool.” Hilda and
her mother laughed pleasantly at his bluff behavior,
and sought to put him at his ease; but Wate would
have no more; he strode off to the hall among the
king and his men, and in an hour or so became himself
again. For the king won on him. Hagen’s
big voice, his battle knowledge, and his love of fight,
opened Yarl Wate’s heart, and the two were soon
made friends. But for the women, there was none
in their esteem like the sweet-voiced Horant. He
was fair to look upon as a woman, yet had no lack
of courage in the battle time. His wit was quick;
and when he talked his face was in a glow at sight
of the strange pictures in his mind, whereby he
likened things to one another in curious sort, so that
all which heard him wondered and were glad.</p>

<p>Now Hagen spake much with Wate concerning
sword play, and the mystery thereof. So presently
Yarl Wate besought the king to appoint him a
master of fence to teach him a little of it, because
fencing after their manner was a thing in which he
was little learned. Then King Hagen sent for the
best fence master that he had, and set him to teach
Yarl Wate the rules of sword play. But quickly
losing patience at the long list of early rules which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the fence master laid down, Hagen caught the foil
from out his hands crying: “Away with you! Why
all this stuff? In four strokes I will teach this man
to use a sword.”</p>

<p>So the king fell to with Wate, whom, however,
he very soon found an exceeding skilful master of
fence. Thereat being somewhat angry, he struck
in fiercely; and they both carried on the sport till
the buttons flew off the foils; yet neither gat the
better of the other. Then Hagen throwing down
his foil cried: “In sooth, never saw I youth learn
so quickly.” And Yrolt said: “There is very little
wherein the serving men of our lord’s country are
not already learned.”</p>

<p>So as Yarl Wate and his fellows abode continually
at the king’s court and feasted with him
every day, it befell once on a time, when night was
past and the day had begun to dawn, that Horant
arose and tuned his voice to a song. The birds,
waking in the hedges, had begun to sing, but hearing
music sweeter than theirs, they held their peace.
Ever higher and sweeter Horant lifted his song
till it rang about the palace; and all the sleepers
dreamed of Baldur and his home in Ganzblick in
the sky.</p>

<p>Soon they woke; nor were they sorry to lose
their dreams at hearing Horant’s song. Hagen
heard it and rose up from his bed. Hilda and her
maidens heard it, and arose. Men and women came
thronging to thank the singer; but when they came
the song was done. Yet none the more would the
birds begin their lays; they had lost their notes from
wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Hilda besought her father that by any
means he should constrain Horant to sing again.
And Hagen being no less crazed with the song,
recked not for aught else, and he promised the
singer a thousand pounds of gold by weight if he
would sing again at eve.</p>

<p>At evening Horant sang. The people filled the
hall and flocked about the castle for a great space.
The sick came thither and remembered their pains
no more.</p>

<p>The beasts in the forest and the cattle in the
fields left their food; the worms forgat to go in the
grass, and the fishes left swimming in the sea. And
when the song was done and the folk went their
ways, they heard the minster choirs and the chiming
of the bells, but took no more pleasure in them.</p>

<p>Hilda sent twelve purses of gold to Horant, entreating
him to come and sing to her in her chamber.
The singer came and sang the song of Amile, the
like whereof no man had ever heard save on the wild
flute. No gold was ever so good. The maiden laid
her hand within the singer’s and bade him choose
whatever he listed for a song-gift. He said: “I
pray thee give me but the girdle from thy waist,
that I may take it to my master.” She asked: “Who
is thy master?” He answered: “No banished men
are we, but servants of Hettel, King of Denmark,
come to woo thee for his bride.” Then Hilda said:
“So thou couldst always sing to me at morn and eve,
I would not care whose bride I were.” Horant
said: “Lady, within my master’s courts abide
twelve minstrels, better far than I; and yet with all
the sweetness of their singing my lord sings best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
all.” And Hilda said: “If that be so, I fain would
follow thee and be King Hettel’s bride. But I
know not how. My father will give me to no suitor
with his good will. I would go but I durst not.”
Horant answered her: “Since thou wouldst, be it
ours to dare. We ask no more.”</p>

<p>Then Horant and his comrades got ready their
ship for sea, and afterward they came to Hagen,
saying: “The time for our departure draweth nigh,
and we must sail to other lands. But before we go,
we pray you bring the queen and your fair daughter,
that they may see the treasures which we have
within the ship.” So on the next day, after mass,
King Hagen came down to the beach, with his
queen, and the fair Hilda and her maids; with them
went a thousand good knights of Ireland. The ship
was swung to a single cable, the anchor aboard,
the sail tackle free. Upon the sands were spread
the Danish treasure chests, filled with costly raiment
embroidered with gold and jewels. There
was a crowding round the chests to see; Yarl
Wate was there, and Frute, and Horant; and in
the crowding Hilda was parted from her mother.
Hagen and his knights saw nothing for the crowd,
and the queen forgot her daughter at beholding
the glories of the raiment. But suddenly they
heard a shout, and looking up beheld Yarl Wate
leap on the bulwarks with fair Hilda in his arms;
the next moment Horant and Frute sprang on
board with two other maidens. Yrolt smote at
the cable with his axe; it parted. The sail was
hauled aloft, and twenty oars shot out from
either side to lift the ship along. Hagen and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
knights ran quickly down into the sea; but the
rowers rowed hard, and armed men in the ship
arose, seven hundred strong, and laid about them.
Short was the fight, and soon the vessel reached
deep water. Loud laughed the Danes to see on
the fading shore the angry crowd, the weeping
queen, and Hagen raging like a madman, up to
his waist in the sea.</p>

<p>Fast sped the ship and the wind was fair. The
Danes made Hegelingen in ten days, and Hettel
was wed to Hilda with great joy.</p>

<p>But while they yet sat at the marriage feast
Hagen’s war-ship bore down upon their coast.
Quickly the Danes rose from the tables, put their
armor on, and ran down to the shore. Hagen
drave his ship upon the sand, and leaped into the
water with his men. A shower of arrows thick as
hail was his greeting. Hettel rushed foremost to
withstand him. There was fierce fighting between
the two for a little space; then Hettel fell, sore
wounded; and over his body Hagen and his
knights pressed on and hewed their way to land.
Fast fell the men, both Danes and Irelanders. Then
Yarl Wate encountered Hagen; and the battle
anger fell on both the men; they fought like wild
beasts of the wood, till, Wate being wounded on
the head, Hagen’s war-pike brake at the next blow
he struck. Meantime the battle raged furiously.
The Irelanders kept their footing, but could not
drive back the Danish men; the numbers slain on
either hand were equal, man for man. Then Hettel’s
wounds being bound up, the Danish king cried
out to Hagen: “Of what avail shall it be to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
or me to fight this battle out? For every man of
mine that falls a man of thine goes down. When
it is done there will be an end to Danes and Irelanders
alike. But if thou must needs prolong the
fight, I will now meet thee, and if Hilda weeps for
a dead husband she shall mourn a dead father too.”
Then Hagen cast down his sword, and called off
his men. And he said to Hettel: “Give me thy
hand; for in sooth my child has married a brave
man; and had I half a score more daughters they
should all come to Hegelingen.” So the kings
made peace together. And the marriage feast was
all begun again, and kept for twelve days in King
Hettel’s palace. Moreover a wise woman brought
forth herbs and roots, and healed the warriors of
their wounds. And after the feasting, Hagen and
his men were loaded with gifts, and they entered
into their ship and departed to Ireland.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LADY_OF_KYNAST">THE LADY OF KYNAST</h2>

<p class="author">By Xavier B. Saintine</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Lady of Kynast owned a large
domain, and on this domain a ruined old tower
which stood on the summit of a steep, high rock,
surrounded on all sides by a deep abyss.</p>

<p>Rich, young and beautiful, eagerly sought for
by a number of admirers, The Lady of Kynast did
not think, in her desire to keep them from becoming
too pressing, of undertaking an endless piece
of embroidery, like Penelope. She did not embroider;
in fact she looked with contempt, and almost
with disgust, upon every kind of work that
was done by women. She told her admirers that
she was betrothed to Kynast—this was the name of
the old tower—and that anyone who thought of
winning her good graces would first have to compete
with her betrothed. To do this nothing was
required but to climb up the rock and the tower,
and having reached the battlements, to make a
complete round, not on foot, however, or assisted
by the hands and knees, but on horseback, without
other assistance than the bridle.</p>

<p>The flock of lovers took flight instantly; only
two remained, two brothers who had completely
lost their heads.</p>

<p>After having cast lots, the first one attempted
the task and seemed on the point of being successful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
But that was all. He had no sooner reached
the crenelated top of the old tower than he was
seized with vertigo and instantly fell into the abyss.</p>

<p>The second brother, in his turn, climbed to the
top and actually succeeded in riding some distance
along the battlements; but soon his horse, feeling
the stones slipping from under its hoofs, and the
whole tower rocking under the weight, refused to
go on. Determined to carry through the undertaking
he encouraged his horse with his voice and
with his spurs, but the poor animal remained immovable,
apparently wedged in between the large
stones of the tower. In the morning both horse
and rider had disappeared.</p>

<p>For quite a while no other claimants appeared to
woo the fair lady, when suddenly one day a third
lover presented himself and asked leave to attempt
the trial.</p>

<p>She did not know who it was, and this surprised
her; for how could he have fallen in love with her?
He might possibly have seen her on her balcony,
or at some royal feast; perhaps he was only allured
by her great reputation. However, there was nothing
to lose by accepting the offer.</p>

<p>For some days a thick, heavy fog had shrouded
the castle and the old tavern from top to bottom, so
as to make the ascent impossible. The simple laws
of hospitality required, therefore, that the lady
should offer her castle to the newly arrived knight.</p>

<p>He proved to be a handsome man with a fine
commanding figure, and the large number of his
servants bespoke his high rank and large fortune.
During three days he spent almost all his time with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the young lady, but as yet he had not dared say a
word of his love. On her side, however, the young
lady felt herself gradually conquered by a feeling
which had, until now, been unknown to her heart.</p>

<p>When the dense veil of mist was at length torn
aside and the Kynast shone forth in its full splendor,
she was on the point of telling the knight that
she would not insist on the trial in his case.</p>

<p>When the moment came the Lady of Kynast
felt her heart fail her. She shut herself in, she wept
and she cried, and prayed that he might be successful.
Loud clamors were heard below, and as she
thought the spectators were bewailing the death of
her last lover, she fainted away.</p>

<p>Cries of joy and of triumph roused her again;
the knight had successfully accomplished the task.
Overcome, she rushes to meet him, and in her excitement
she forgets that all eyes are upon her, and
breathlessly cries out: “My hand is yours.” But he
draws himself up to his full height, and haughtily
and harshly he replies, with a proud smile:</p>

<p>“Have I ever asked you for your hand? I only
came to avenge my two brothers, whom you have
killed, and I have done it, for I do not, could not,
love you, and yet you love me. Farewell!”</p>

<p>That same evening the wretched lady had herself
conducted up to the top of the tower, from
whence she wished, she said, to watch the setting
sun. She was never seen alive again.</p>

<h2 id="THE_GUARDIAN_ANGEL">THE GUARDIAN ANGEL</h2>

<p class="author">By Xavier B. Saintine</p>

<p class="dropcap">A white figure appeared before the young
girl as she awoke. “I am your Guardian
Angel!”</p>

<p>“Then you will grant me the wishes which I shall
mention?”</p>

<p>“I shall carry them to God’s throne. You may
count upon my assistance. What are your wishes?”</p>

<p>“O White Angel, I am tired of continually turning
the spindle and my fingers are getting to be so
hard by constant work that yesterday, at the dance,
my partner might have imagined he was holding a
wooden hand.”</p>

<p>“Your partner was that fine-looking gentleman
from Hesse? Did he not tell you that he adored
blue eyes and fair hair, and that he would make you
a baroness, if you would go home with him, if you
would wickedly run away?”</p>

<p>“White Angel, make me a baroness!”</p>

<p>The evening of that day a young peasant came
and asked Louisa’s mother for her daughter’s hand.
The mother said, Yes.</p>

<p>“White Angel, deliver me from this poor man.
I want to be a baroness!”</p>

<p>The mother, who was a sensible woman, and a
widow, had good sense enough and energy enough
for two. The White Angel did not appear again,
and Louisa married the peasant—and she kept on
turning the spindle.</p>

<p>One day her husband, who was a hard-working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
man, had over-exerted himself and was taken ill.
In the meanwhile Louisa had seen her handsome
gentleman again.</p>

<p>“White Angel,” she said, “he loves me still. He
has sworn he would marry me if I were a widow.”
She dared not say more. The husband recovered
from his illness. The White Angel still turned a
deaf ear to her wishes. She lost all hope of ever
becoming a baroness.</p>

<p>Later her husband became more successful, so
that his work alone supplied all their wants. Two
beautiful children had come to gladden their lives,
and now, when Louisa worked at the spindle, it felt
quite soft in her fingers.</p>

<p>One evening, when she was only half asleep, the
white figure appeared once more, and a gentle voice
whispered in her ear this story:</p>

<p>“A little fish was merrily swimming about in
the water and looking seriously at a pretty blackcap
which first circled around and around in the
air, and then alighted on a branch of a willow which
grew close to the bank of the river.</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ said the little fish, ‘how happy that bird
is! It can rise up to the heavens and go high up to
the sun to warm itself in its rays. Why cannot I
do the same?’</p>

<p>“The blackcap, who was looking down at the
fish, thought to himself:</p>

<p>“‘Oh! how happy that fish is! The element in
which it lives furnishes it at the same time with
food; it has nothing to do but to glide along. How
I should like to sport in the fresh, transparent
water!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“At that moment a kite pounced upon the poor
little fish, while a scamp of a schoolboy threw a
stone at the bird; the blackcap fell into the water—the
fresh, transparent water—and for a moment
struggled in it before it died, while the little fish,
carried aloft, could go up on high to the sun and
warm itself in its rays. Their wishes had been
granted.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_GIANT_WHO_LAUGHED_AT_A">THE GIANT WHO LAUGHED AT A
DWARF</h2>

<p class="author">By Xavier B. Saintine</p>

<p class="dropcap">An old duke of Bavaria had at his court a dwarf
named Ephesim, and a giant named Grommelund.
The giant laughed at the dwarf, and the
dwarf threatened to box his ears. Grommelund
laughed a big hoarse laugh that seemed to come
up from his toes, and dared Ephesim to go ahead.
The dwarf accepted the challenge at once, and the
duke, having been a witness of the scene, ordered
that a field for a single combat should be gotten
ready.</p>

<p>Everybody expected to do as the giant had done,
and laugh at the pigmy, as the poor little fellow
was hardly two feet high and would have had to
climb a long way before reaching the giant’s ears.</p>

<p>The dwarf began by walking all around the
giant, as if to take his measure. The good-natured
giant, standing up immovable, looks down upon
him and quietly laughs till his sides shake; but
while he is holding his hands to his sides, the dwarf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
unties his shoestrings and then worries him by
kicking and pinching his calves.</p>

<p>Grommelund laughs more loudly than ever,
thanks to the tickling; takes a few strides, steps on
his loose shoestrings, nearly stumbles, and at last,
with thoughtful presence of mind, stoops down to
tie the strings.</p>

<p>Ephesim was watching for this. He quickly
slapped the giant’s cheek so vigorous and sounding
a smack that the duke and all the lords of the court
looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>The poor giant was so shamed and humiliated
that he hurriedly shambled off the field and sought
refuge in the mountains, where, it is said, he hid
himself and refused to come out.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LEGEND_OF_SAINT">THE LEGEND OF SAINT
CHRISTOPHER</h2>

<p class="author">By Lillian M. Gask</p>

<p class="dropcap">There was once a man named Offero, so tall
and strong that he stood among his fellows as
a sturdy oak in a grove of saplings. His eyes
were keen and clear as some great eagle’s, his lips
spoke nothing but gentle words, and his heart was
as pure and tender as a little child’s. His spirit
was brave and fearless, and while he was yet in the
prime of his strength he resolved to devote it to
some good purpose.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said, when he had called together
his companions, “I must leave you now, for
something within me whispers that I was born to
serve a king so great that fear is unknown to him;
a king to whom all men bow.”</p>

<p>Then he strode away into the forest, and was
seen by them no more.</p>

<p>For many a day he traversed valley and mountain,
inquiring of all he met who was the greatest
king. At last he came to a splendid country, where
reigned a monarch of high renown. His armies
were vast and powerful, and his fleet of warships
was like a flock of birds bearing death on their grim
brown wings.</p>

<p>When he was told that Offero desired to serve
him, he welcomed him gladly, and liked the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
man so well that he soon made him his trusted
counsellor and friend.</p>

<p>It was Offero’s pride to see how all men trembled
at his master’s frown, and he could not believe that
there lived a monarch greater than he.</p>

<p>One day, however, when the king was present, a
courtier made some remark about “the Evil One;”
his Majesty’s august brow grew pale, and Offero
could have sworn he saw his stem lips quiver.
Pained and surprised, he humbly asked the king
why he was troubled.</p>

<p>“I am afraid of the Devil,” said that monarch,
“although I fear no mortal man. He is
the King of Hades, and more powerful even
than I.”</p>

<p>“Then I must leave you, O king!” cried Offero
with haste, “since I have vowed to serve none other
than the most powerful monarch in existence.”
And sorrowfully he turned away.</p>

<p>“Where is the Devil?” he asked the first man
he met.</p>

<p>“He is everywhere,” returned the traveller, looking
round uneasily; and this was the usual answer
that Offero received to his inquiry. Wherever he
went men looked uneasy at the Devil’s name, but
would not say where Offero was most likely to
meet with him.</p>

<p>He found him at last among a group of idle men
and maidens on the village green, and hailed him as
his master. The Devil was glad to have so strong
a follower, and amused himself by showing the
astonished giant his power over rich and poor.
There seemed to be no limit to his might; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
swayed the nobles in their velvet robes, and the
peasants in their tattered garments.</p>

<p>“He is indeed master of the world,” sighed
Offero, and though he liked not the Devil’s ways,
he stifled his distaste that he might keep his word.</p>

<p>One day his master led him through the outskirts
of the town into the open country.</p>

<p>“We are going to visit a hermit,” he said with a
burst of laughter. “He has left the town to be
quit of me, but he will find me in his cave!”</p>

<p>Before Offero could ask him what he meant to
do with the good hermit, they came to a turn where
four roads met. A rough wind swayed the branches
of the trees, and a peal of thunder echoed among
the lofty hills. It was neither wind nor thunder,
however, that made the Devil tremble, but the sight
of a wooden cross which some pious folk had erected
here. With gaunt arms pointing east and west it
stood immovable; the rain beat down on it mercilessly,
as if to cleanse it from the roadside dust; and
turning his head away that he might not see it, the
Devil hastened past. Not until it was far behind
them had Offero an opportunity of asking why he
had trembled.</p>

<p>“I was afraid,” answered his grim companion,
with another shudder.</p>

<p>“Afraid?” repeated Offero in puzzled tones.
“Why, what was there to be afraid of?”</p>

<p>“Did you not see the crucifix?” cried the Devil
impatiently. “The figure on it is that of the Christ,
and this is why I trembled.”</p>

<p>The giant had never heard that Holy Name before,
and felt more perplexed than ever as he demanded:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
“Who is this Christ whom you so
fear?”</p>

<p>“He is the King of Heaven,” was the reluctant
reply.</p>

<p>“Is he more powerful, then, than you?” persisted
Offero, planting himself in the center of the pathway
so that his master could not pass on.</p>

<p>“He is more powerful even than I!” admitted
the Devil, his eyes becoming points of fire.</p>

<p>“Then I shall serve Him, and Him only,” the
giant cried, and, turning on his heel, he left the
Devil to go on his way alone.</p>

<p>When Offero reached the cross once more, a man
was kneeling before it in prayer. As he rose from
his knees, Offero asked him the way to Heaven.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you,” said the man. “The way
is long, and hard to find. ’Tis well that Christ is
merciful.”</p>

<p>Offero met with like answers from many wayfarers
whom he questioned, but at last came one
who advised him to consult the hermit.</p>

<p>“He is a holy man,” he assured him earnestly,
“and has retired from the world that he may give
his time to prayer and fasting. He thinks he can
serve Christ this way better than any other.”</p>

<p>So Offero sought the hermit, and learnt from
him many things. He heard of the grandeur and
goodness of Christ, and of the greatness of His
Kingdom. All that he said made Offero more eager
to serve Him than ever, and when the hermit explained
that no one could enter the Heavenly Kingdom
until he was summoned there by Christ Himself,
he bowed his head in disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“How then can I serve this new Master,” he said,
“unless I can see Him and hear His commands?”</p>

<p>“Do as I do,” replied the hermit. “Give up the
world, and fast and pray.”</p>

<p>“If I were to fast,” said Offero shrewdly, “I
should lose my strength, and then, when He called
me to work for Him, I should be useless.” And
although the hermit tried to persuade him, he would
not stay, but set off again on his journey, determined
to find the way to Heaven.</p>

<p>Presently he met a company of pilgrims. They
were dusty and travel-stained, and very footsore,
but their faces shone with joy. There were men
and women and little children; some came from
distant lands, and some from near, but one and all
they were filled with a deep content.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and whence do you travel?”
Offero asked them wonderingly.</p>

<p>“We are the servants of Christ,” they answered,
“and we are marching towards Heaven. The path
is rough, and the way is long, but His many mansions
await us.”</p>

<p>“I will come with you, and be His servant too!”
said Offero, and they welcomed him gladly.</p>

<p>The way was long, as they had said, but to the
giant the days passed quickly. He was learning
so much that he could scarcely sleep for the wonder
of it, and his face also shone with happiness.
He grew very grave when he heard of the swift-flowing
river that all must cross before they could
hope to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>“There is no bridge to span it,” said an aged pilgrim,
whose tottering limbs were now so feeble that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
but for Offero’s support they would hardly have
borne him along. “The trembling woman, the little
child, must cross it alone in the gloom and darkness,
for though they call, no friendly boatman appears
in sight. When Christ has need of us, His messenger
will appear; he is clothed in raiment white as
snow, and although his voice is always gentle, it is
as clearly heard in the rush and roar of the tempest
as on a summer’s day.”</p>

<p>At length the pilgrims came to the river-bank,
and as the giant gazed at the foaming current, and
saw the waves dashing against the shore, he marvelled
greatly at what he had been told. Surely, he
thought, no feeble woman or little child could
breast its waters and reach the other side.</p>

<p>Even as he mused on this the white-robed messenger
called to an ailing girl who was almost too
weak to move. Her Master had need of her, he
said, and in the fair courts of Heaven she would
be strong again.</p>

<p>What joy was hers when she heard His voice!
But alas! when she crept to the edge of the bank,
and saw the river that swept beneath it, her heart
grew sick with fear. She quivered and shook from
head to foot, and moaned that she dare not venture.
An exceeding pity moved Offero to go to
her help.</p>

<p>“Do not weep,” he said, “but trust to me.” And
taking her tenderly in his arms, he lifted her on to
his shoulder, and bore her tenderly across. In spite
of all his strength, the pitiless current nearly swept
him off his feet, and he fought with the icy waters
as he had fought no mortal foe. The girl tried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
vain to thank him as he placed her on the bank in
safety; he would not let her speak.</p>

<p>“Tell Christ,” he said, “that I am His servant,
and that until He shall summon me to His side I
will help His pilgrims to cross the River of Death.”</p>

<p>From henceforth this was his work. He had no
time to wonder when his own call would come, for
day and night there arrived at the banks of the river
pilgrims from every clime, and, since few had courage
to face the dark waters alone, he crossed and
recrossed it continually. In order that he might be
always at hand, he built himself a rough log-hut by
the waterside, and here he made his home.</p>

<p>One night when the waves rolled fiercely and the
wind blew high, Offero laid him down to sleep.
Surely, he thought, no one would dare to cross in
such a storm. His eyes had scarcely closed, however,
when he heard a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he cried as he threw it open.
There was no answer, and by the light of his lantern
he saw a wistful child on the river-bank. He
was staring down at the rushing waters with piteous
dread, but the tone of his voice was clear and
firm as he turned and spoke to Offero.</p>

<p>“I must cross to-night,” he said. Offero looked
at him with deep compassion.</p>

<p>“Poor child!” he murmured, “I am glad I heard
you. With a tide like this it will be difficult even
for me, giant as I am, but you would be swept
away.”</p>

<p>With gentle hands he placed the boy on his
shoulder, and bidding him not to fear, set out for
the opposite shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not overestimated the difficulties he had
to face. Time after time he was beaten backward,
and the icy waters nearly engulfed them both. It
took all his strength to bear up against them, and
the weight of the child seemed greater than that of
the heaviest man he had ever borne. When at last
he climbed the steep, high bank, he was bruised as
well as breathless, for the hidden rocks had worked
him grievous harm.</p>

<p>“Tell Christ——” he panted. And then he saw
that the figure beside him was not that of a little
child, but of a radiant Being of kingly mien, with
a crown of glory on His brow. The giant knelt
before Him, and the Vision smiled.</p>

<p>“I am the Christ,” He said, “whom thou hast
served so long. This night thou hast borne Me
across the River of Death.… Thou didst find Me
a heavy burden, for I bore the sins of the world.”</p>

<p>Then He named Giant Offero “Christopher,”
meaning “He who has carried Christ,” and took
him to dwell with Him in His Heavenly Kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="PRINCE_IVAN_AND_THE_GRAY_WOLF">PRINCE IVAN AND THE GRAY WOLF</h2>

<p class="author">By Lillian M. Gask</p>

<p class="dropcap">In a far-off land surrounded by snow-capped
mountains, and watered by rivers that flowed
swiftly down to the sea, dwelt a mighty tsar. His
people loved as well as feared him, for the glance of
his eagle eye was very kind, and he was ever ready
to listen to their pleas for help or justice. When he
rode abroad on the great white horse that was shod
with gold, they flocked to bless him, and throughout
the whole of his wide dominion there was not one
discontented man, woman, or child. He had no foes
to trouble him, since rival monarchs knew full well
that their troops would be dispersed like mist in
sunlight before the charge of his victorious army,
and his three sons, Dimitri, Vasili, and Ivan, were
all that a father could desire. Yet the good tsar’s
brow was clouded as he walked in his garden, and
from time to time he uttered a deep sigh.</p>

<p>This garden was his greatest pride. In days gone
by the forests had been rifled of their most splendid
trees that they might spread their shade over the
rare and lovely flowers that travellers brought him
from every part of the globe. The perfume of his
million rose trees was carried on the wind for fifty
miles beyond the palace, and so wonderful were
their colors that the eyes of those who beheld them
were dazzled by so much brilliance. There were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
gorgeous orchids which, in order that the garden
of their beloved tsar might be the most beautiful in
the world, men had risked their lives to obtain, and
every imaginable kind of fruit hung in tempting
clusters from the drooping boughs of the trees. To
look at them was to make one’s mouth water, and
the sick folk in his kingdom shared with the tsar
the pleasures of taste and touch.</p>

<p>The tree that gave him most pleasure bore nothing
but golden apples. When spring came round,
and tender buds appeared upon the whispering
branches, the tsar caused a net of fine white seed-pearls
to be spread around it, so that the sweet-voiced
choristers who filled his groves with music
should not come near them. They might feast at
will on every other tree in his garden, he said, but
the golden apples they must leave for him; and as
if in gratitude for his many kindnesses, even when
the net of pearls was taken away, and the apples
gleamed like fairy gold amid the emerald-green of
their shapely leaves, not one of the birds approached
them. When cares of state pressed heavily upon
him, the tsar sought rest beneath the loaded
branches, and forgot his troubles in watching the
sunlight play on the golden balls.</p>

<p>Now all was changed, and the tsar’s deep sigh
betokened feelings of deep annoyance. Morning
after morning he found the apple tree stripped of
its golden treasures, and its emerald leaves strewn
on the ground.</p>

<p>This was the work of the Magic Bird, who once
upon a time had lived in the great cloud castles
that gather in the West, but was now the slave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a distant king. The feathers of the Magic Bird
were as radiant as the sun-god’s plumes, and her
eyes as clear as crystal. When she had wrought
her will on the apple trees, she would fly blithely
home to the garden of her own master, and, try as
they would, not one of the tsar’s head gardeners
could even catch sight of her.</p>

<p>The good tsar meditated much upon the matter,
and one windy morning in autumn he called his
three sons to him.</p>

<p>“My children,” he said, “the source of my grief
is known to you, and now I entreat your help.
Will you each in turn forego your sleep, that you
may watch in my garden for the Magic Bird? To
him who shall capture her, I will give the half of
my kingdom, and when I am called thence he shall
reign in my stead.”</p>

<p>“Willingly, O my father,” answered each of his
three sons; and Prince Dimitri, as the eldest,
claimed the right to the first watch.</p>

<p>The garden was flooded with moonlight as the
prince threw himself down on a moss-grown bank
that faced the tree, and the fragrance of the roses
soon worked its drowsy spell. From a grove of
myrtles came the song of a sweet-voiced nightingale:
“<i>Glück—glück—glück</i>,” she trilled, and in
listening to her the prince fell fast asleep. When
he awoke it was light again. The tree had been
once more despoiled, and the Magic Bird had flown.</p>

<p>The same thing occurred when Prince Vasili took
his turn in watching. It is only fair to him to say
that he did not fall asleep until the night was far
spent, but as the east began to quiver with light, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
too became overpowered with slumber. The Magic
Bird was watching her opportunity, and yet again
she robbed the tree. When questioned by the tsar,
both princes solemnly assured him that no strange
bird had visited the garden during the night, but
though he fain would have believed them, he could
not doubt the evidence of his eyes.</p>

<p>It was now Prince Ivan’s turn to watch. He
was not nearly so good-looking as his brothers, but
he had a stout heart and a cool head, and he made
up his mind to keep awake at any cost. Instead of
reclining on the ground, he perched himself in the
boughs of the tree, and when the song of the
nightingale threatened to lull him to sleep, as it had
done the elder princes, he put his fingers into his
ears that he might not hear it.</p>

<p>An hour passed slowly; a second, and then a
third. Suddenly the whole garden was lit up as if
with a burst of sunshine, and with rays of light
flashing from every shaft of her golden feathers the
Magic Bird flew down and began to peck at the
shining apples. Prince Ivan, scarcely daring to
breathe, stretched out his hand and caught as much
of her tail as he could grasp. With a startled cry
the Magic Bird spread her beautiful wings and
wrenched herself free, leaving behind one glittering
feather, which the prince held firmly. At break of
day he took this to his father, humbly apologizing
for his ill success in not having caught the Magic
Bird herself.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you have done well, my son,” said
the tsar gratefully, and he placed the feather, which
shone so brightly that at dusk it illuminated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
whole room, in a cabinet of cedar and mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>The Magic Bird came no more to the palace garden,
and the precious tree was never again despoiled
of its golden apples. But the tsar was not content.
He sighed to possess the bird that had robbed
him, and once more he summoned his three sons.</p>

<p>“My children,” he said, “I am sick with longing
for the Magic Bird. Seek her, I pray you, and
bring her to me. What I have promised already
shall then be yours.”</p>

<p>The princes assented gladly, each anxious to find
the Magic Bird. Prince Ivan alone wished to
please his father; his brothers were only thinking
of the riches and honors they would gain for themselves.
So dear was this youngest son to the monarch’s
heart that he was loath to part with him when
the time came, but the youth insisted.</p>

<p>“It will not be for long, dear father,” he cried
“I shall soon return with the Magic Bird you sigh
for.” So the tsar blessed him, and let him go.</p>

<p>Prince Ivan took the fleetest horse in the imperial
stables, and rode on and on for many days. At
last he came to a bare field set in the midst of fair
green meadows, and in the center of this stood a
block of rough gray stone. Inscribed upon the
stone in crimson letters was a strange verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hungry and cold shall that man be</div>
<div class="verse">Who rides in pride straight up to me.</div>
<div class="verse">To ride from the left means death and sorrow,</div>
<div class="verse">Though his horse shall live for many a morrow.</div>
<div class="verse">He who rides from the right shall have good things all,</div>
<div class="verse">But ere three days pass his horse shall fall!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Ivan was greatly troubled at the thought
of losing his horse, but to ride from the right seemed
the wisest course for him to pursue. Accordingly
he did so, and so swift was his horse’s flight that he
had soon left the gray stone far behind. On the
third day, as he was passing the borders of a
gloomy forest, a big Gray Wolf sprang out from a
thicket, and, flying at his horse’s throat, threw him
on the ground and killed him in spite of Ivan’s
gallant attempt to beat him off. Ivan would now
have run the Gray Wolf through with the jeweled
dagger his father had given him as a parting present,
but before he could rise from the spot where he
had been thrown, the creature spoke.</p>

<p>“Spare me, wise prince,” he entreated humbly.
“I have but done as I was commanded. My death
will not give you back your horse, while if you
spare my life I will be your friend forever, and
will carry you over the world.”</p>

<p>Prince Ivan saw that he would gain nothing by
being revengeful, and, mindful of his quest, accepted
the Wolf’s offer to be his steed.</p>

<p>“Tell me where you wish to go, dear master!”
said the Gray Wolf, “and it shall be as you will.”
And, true enough, when he heard the object of
Prince Ivan’s journey, he galloped even more
swiftly than the horse had done, till toward nightfall
he came to a standstill behind a thick stone wall.</p>

<p>“On the other side of this wall,” he said, “is a
terraced garden, and there, in a golden cage, is the
Magic Bird. The garden is empty now, so no one
will stay you if you capture her; but if you touch
her cage there will be trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Dismounting from the Gray Wolf’s back, Prince
Ivan climbed the wall without much difficulty, and
quickly seized the Magic Bird. She fluttered so
wildly, however, as he tried to hold her, though
without uttering a sound, that he quite forgot the
Gray Wolf’s warning, and hastened back for the
cage. As he touched it, the stillness of the garden
was broken by the pealing of bells and the clanking
of armor, for the cage was connected with the palace
courtyard by invisible wires. Before he could
escape, Prince Ivan was surrounded by excited soldiers,
who quickly carried him before the king.</p>

<p>“Are you not ashamed?” the monarch thundered,
noting the young man’s rich attire, “to be caught
in my garden like a common thief? Where do you
come from, and what is your name?”</p>

<p>“I am the son of a great tsar,” the young prince
answered, “and they call me Ivan. My father has
a very beautiful garden, in which grows a tree of
golden apples that is the pride of his heart. Night
after night your Magic Bird rifled this precious
fruit, until I all but succeeded in capturing her.
She was too quick for me, however, and flew away,
leaving one feather in my hand. This feather I took
to my father, who admired it greatly, and ever since
has longed to possess the Magic Bird.”</p>

<p>Tsar Dolmat looked less angry, though he still
frowned.</p>

<p>“If you had come to me,” he said, “and told me
what you wanted, I would have made your father
a present of the Magic Bird. As it is, I feel inclined
to let all nations know how dishonorably you
have acted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Ivan bowed his head in shame, and after
a searching glance at him the tsar continued his
speech.</p>

<p>“You shall go forth free, young prince,” he said,
“if you will do me a service. In the realm of Tsar
Afron, beyond the thrice-ninth kingdom, there is a
gold-maned horse which belongs to him, and this I
greatly covet. If you will procure it, and bring it
here to me, I will forgive your theft of the Magic
Bird, and present her to you as a mark of honor.”</p>

<p>Prince Ivan promised to do his best, but he did
not feel very hopeful as he rejoined the Gray Wolf,
who was patiently waiting for him outside the wall.
When Ivan had confessed the reason that led to his
capture, the Gray Wolf patted his shoulder with
one rough paw.</p>

<p>“It takes a wise man,” he remarked, “to own himself
in the wrong, so we will say no more about it.
Jump on my back again, and I will take you to the
far-famed realm of Tsar Afron, beyond the thrice-ninth
kingdom.”</p>

<p>The Gray Wolf ran so swiftly that Ivan could
scarcely see the country through which they passed,
and after travelling for many nights and days, they
reached, at last, their journey’s end. The marble
stables of the tsar shone fair and stately in the
morning light, and through a door which a careless
groom had left half open, Prince Ivan made his
way. The horse with the golden mane was feeding
on the yellow pollen collected by the bees from the
tall white lilies that edged the rose garden, and
stared at Prince Ivan haughtily as he approached.
Firmly grasping his golden mane, Prince Ivan led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
him out of the stall. The Gray Wolf had cautioned
him more than once not to attempt to bring the
golden bridle that hung above the door, but as he
was leaving the stable the prince suddenly thought
how useful this would be, and turning back,
stretched out his hand and touched it. Immediately
he did so, bells pealed all over the palace, for, like
the cage of the Magic Bird, the Bridle was fastened
to invisible wires.</p>

<p>The stable guards came hurrying in, full of
alarm, and when they saw Prince Ivan they seized
him angrily, and took him before their master.
Tsar Afron was even more indignant than Tsar
Dolmat had been at the prince’s attempt to rob
him. When he had questioned him as to his birth
and station his face became sterner still.</p>

<p>“Is this the deed of a gallant knight?” he asked
with withering scorn. “I have a great regard for
your father’s name, and if you had come to me
openly and in good faith, I would gladly have given
you my gold-maned horse. But now all nations
shall know of your dishonor, for such acts of yours
must not go unpunished.”</p>

<p>This was more than Prince Ivan could bear, and
with eager haste he protested his willingness to
atone for his fault.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Tsar Afron, “I will take
you at your word. Go forth and bring me Queen
Helen the Beautiful, whom I have long loved with
all my heart and soul. I have seen a picture of
her in my seer’s white crystal, and she is more fair
to look upon than any other maid. I cannot reach
her, try as I may, since her kingdom is guarded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
elves and goblins. If you can capture her for me
and bring her here, in return I will give you anything
you ask.”</p>

<p>Prince Ivan hurried away to the Gray Wolf,
fearing that since he had disregarded his advice for
a second time, he might refuse to help him in this
new enterprise. Once more he humbly confessed
that he had been at fault, and once more the Gray
Wolf consoled him.</p>

<p>“One must buy wit,” he growled. “Well, jump
on my back, and I will see what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>Then he ran so swiftly that it seemed as though
his feet were winged, and the elves and goblins that
guarded the kingdom of Helen the Beautiful scattered
before him in all directions, thinking him to be
a specter. When he came to the golden streamlet
that bordered the queen’s magic garden, he told
Prince Ivan that he must now dismount.</p>

<p>“Go back by the road we came,” he commanded,
“and wait for me in the shade of that spreading oak
tree we passed just now.”</p>

<p>Prince Ivan did as he was told, and the Gray
Wolf crouched under a bush of juniper, and waited
until evening fell. As the light faded out of the
sunset sky and the pale little moon rose slowly over
the mountain-tops, Queen Helen walked in her
garden. She was so fair and sweet to look upon
that even the heart of the Gray Wolf was moved
to admiration, and he wished her a worthier mate
than the stern Tsar Afron, who knew not how
to be gentle even in his love. After a while she
approached the streamlet, winding round her
dainty throat a cloud of milk-white gossamer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that she might not feel the touch of the evening
breeze.</p>

<p>“Do not fear, sweet lady! I will not harm you!”
the Gray Wolf cried, as he sprang from his hiding
place and crossed the stream. Holding her tenderly
by her flowing draperies, he leaped back to
the other side, and galloped with her to the prince,
who waited under the spreading oak.</p>

<p>When the queen and prince beheld each other, it
was as if a veil had fallen from their eyes. Never
had the world appeared so beautiful, and as they
gazed at each other in the soft twilight, the queen’s
fears fled. As for Prince Ivan, he knew from that
moment that she was intended for his wife, and
when they rode away together on the Gray Wolf’s
back, he already felt that she belonged to him.</p>

<p>The journey was all too short, and soon Tsar
Afron’s palace loomed before them.</p>

<p>“Why are you weeping?” the Gray Wolf inquired,
as their tears splashed on his head. Queen
Helen could make no answer, but Prince Ivan’s
words poured forth like a raging flood.</p>

<p>“How can we help it, Gray Wolf,” he cried,
“since we love each other, and I must resign my
beautiful queen to the stern Tsar Afron, or else be
branded before all nations as a robber and a thief?”</p>

<p>“I have kept my promise, Prince Ivan,” said the
Gray Wolf, “and served you well, but I will do
more for you still. By means of magic known to
myself alone, I, the Gray Wolf, will take the form
of beautiful Queen Helen. You shall leave the
real queen here, in the shade of this grove of pine
trees, and when you have taken Tsar Afron his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
strange wolf bride, who will appear to him as a
lovely woman with golden hair, he will give you the
gold-maned horse. Bid him farewell as quickly as
you can, and, taking your queen behind you, ride
swiftly toward the west. When I have given you
time to journey far, I will ask Tsar Afron to let me
walk with my maidens in the woods. Then, if you
call me to your mind, I shall disappear, from their
midst even as they watch me, and join you and
your queen.”</p>

<p>Prince Ivan once more did as the Gray Wolf
said, and great was the delight of the Tsar Afron
as he beheld the tall and gracious woman whom the
prince presented to him. She was even more beautiful
than he had imagined from her picture, and
he would have given not only his gold-maned horse,
but his crown as well, to her captor had he desired
it. Prince Ivan, however, asked nothing but the
gold-maned horse, and was soon speeding across the
plains with the real Queen Helen nestling against
his side. He rode toward the west, where lay the
kingdom of Tsar Dolmat.</p>

<p>Tsar Afron was more than content with his
wolfish bride, who was not alarmed by his fierce
caresses, and only smiled when he threatened to kill
her if her love for him should waver for a single
instant. On the fourth day after their marriage
feast she complained of feeling stifled in the royal
palace.</p>

<p>“If I might walk in the meadows,” she said, “the
breath of the cool fresh air would refresh my
spirit, and I could once more laugh with my lord.”</p>

<p>So the tsar allowed her to walk with her maidens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Just at this time the thought of the Gray Wolf
flashed into Prince Ivan’s head.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten him,” he exclaimed remorsefully
to his dear wife. “What is he doing, I wonder?
I wish we had him here.”</p>

<p>He had no sooner spoken than there came a clap
of thunder from the distant hills, and the Gray
Wolf suddenly appeared.</p>

<p>“You must let the queen ride the gold-maned
horse alone,” he told the prince, “and I will be your
steed.”</p>

<p>Somewhat reluctantly, the prince accepted his
suggestion, and in this manner they rode to the
verge of Tsar Dolmat’s capital. The kindly looks
of the Gray Wolf emboldened the prince to ask
him another favor.</p>

<p>“Since you can change yourself into a beautiful
woman, and then back again into a Gray Wolf,
could you not become for a time a gold-maned
horse, so that I might give you to Tsar Dolmat, and
keep the real one for my dear queen?”</p>

<p>The Gray Wolf readily assented, and striking his
right paw three times in succession on a patch of
bare earth, became the exact image of the gold-maned
horse who bore the fair Queen Helen. Leaving
the real horse with his bride in a flower-strewn
meadow outside the city, Prince Ivan rode on to
the tsar. He was greeted by that monarch with
every sign of joy, for the mane of the Gray Wolf-horse
shone in the sunshine like purest gold. The
tsar kissed Prince Ivan on either cheek, and leading
him to his palace, gave him a royal feast. For three
whole days they reveled in the choicest wines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the richest viands the kingdom could supply, and
on the third, Tsar Dolmat rewarded the prince
with many thanks, and the gift of the Magic Bird
in her golden cage.</p>

<p>Prince Ivan felt now that his quest was over, and
quickly regaining Queen Helen’s side, he fastened
the cage of the Magic Bird round the neck of the
gold-maned horse, and rode with her toward his
father’s kingdom. Early the next afternoon they
were joined by the Gray Wolf; Tsar Dolmat had
ridden his newly acquired treasure in an open field,
and had been heavily thrown for his pains by the
false horse, which had then galloped away.</p>

<p>As the Gray Wolf had been so good a friend
to him, Prince Ivan could not refuse his request
when he asked to be allowed to carry him, so once
more the queen alone sat on the gold-maned horse.</p>

<p>Thus they rode on until they came to the place
where the Gray Wolf had slain the horse which
Prince Ivan had brought from his father’s stable.
Here the strange creature came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>“I have done all that I said, and more,” he told
the prince. “Now I am your servant no longer.
Farewell!” And he galloped back to the gloomy
wood from which he had first come.</p>

<p>Prince Ivan’s sorrow at parting with him was
very real, but in the pleasure afforded by the queen’s
company he soon forgot his loss. When he came
within sight of his father’s realm, he stopped by the
shade of a belt of fir trees, and placing the cage of
the Magic Bird and the golden bridle beneath their
shade, he lifted down his beautiful queen, and rested
with her on a bank of fern. They were weary after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
their long journey, and soon, talking together softly
as ring-doves coo in their nests, both fell asleep.</p>

<p>Now Prince Dimitri and Prince Vasili had fared
badly on their travels, and were returning to the
palace, empty-handed, and sadly out of temper,
when they caught sight of the reclining forms of
the two sleepers, with the gold-maned horse browsing
close beside them. As they stared in amazement,
an evil spirit of envy took possession of them,
and there presently entered into their minds the
thought of killing their brother. Each looked at
the other, and then Prince Dimitri drew his sword,
and ran it through Prince Ivan as he slept; he died
without a murmur, and when the queen awoke, she
found him lifeless.</p>

<p>“What is this you have done?” she sobbed to the
guilty princes. “If you had met him in fair fight,
and slain him thus, he might at least have struck a
blow in self-defense. But you are cowards and
dastards, fit only for ravens’ food!”</p>

<p>In vain she wept and protested, as the princes
drew lots for their dead brother’s possessions. The
queen fell to the keeping of Prince Vasili, and the
gold-maned horse was adjudged to Prince Dimitri.
In a passion of tears, the queen hid her face in her
golden hair, as her would-be lord spoke roughly to
her.</p>

<p>“You are in our power, fair Helen,” he said.
“We shall tell our father that it was we who found
you, the Magic Bird, and the gold-maned horse.
If you deny our words, we will instantly put you
to death, so look to it that you hold your tongue,
and keep our counsel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The poor queen was so terrified by his cruel
threat that speech forsook her, and when they arrived
at the palace she was mute as some marble
statue, and could not contradict the wicked statements
which she heard them boldly utter.</p>

<p>Prince Ivan lay dead with his face to the sky,
but the wood elves guarded his body, so that
neither beast nor bird came near to devour it until
the end of thirty days. Then, as the sun was
sinking, a raven seeking food for her young,
hopped on his breast, and would have pecked at his
eyes had not the Gray Wolf galloped up in the
nick of time. He knew at once that the dead man
must be Ivan, and pouncing upon one of the young
birds, would have torn it asunder in his rage.</p>

<p>“Do not touch my little birdling, O fierce Gray
Wolf!” entreated the mother piteously. “It has
done you no harm, and deserves no ill from you.”</p>

<p>“Then listen,” the Gray Wolf replied. “I will
spare the life of your birdling, if you will fly away
beyond the thrice-ninth lands, and bring me back
the Water of Death and the Water of Life from
the crystal stream whence they flow to the great
Forever.”</p>

<p>“I will do what you wish,” cried the raven, “only
do not touch my little son.” And as she spoke she
sped away.</p>

<p>Three days and three nights had passed before
she returned to the Gray Wolf, carrying two small
vials. One held the Water of Life, the other the
Water of Death, and as the Gray Wolf took them
from her, he gave a cry of triumph. With a snap
of his teeth, he bit the young raven in two, tearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
it to pieces before its mother’s frantic eyes. This
done, he broke one of the vials, and when he had
sprinkled three drops of the Water of Death on
the slain birdling, immediately its torn body grew
together again. Then he touched it with a few
drops from the second vial, and the little thing
spread its wings, and flew off rejoicing.</p>

<p>Thus the Gray Wolf knew that the raven had
served him well, and he poured what was left of the
Waters of Life and Death over the body of the
dead prince. In a few moments, life came back to
him, and stumbling to his feet, he smiled at the
Gray Wolf.</p>

<p>“Have I slept long?” he asked dreamily.</p>

<p>“You would have slept forever had it not been
for me,” was the reply. And the prince listened
with grieved surprise as the Gray Wolf told him all
that had happened.</p>

<p>“Your brother is going to marry your bride
to-day,” he ended by saying. “We must hasten
to the palace with all possible speed. Mount on my
back, and I will carry you once more.”</p>

<p>So they galloped to the palace of the old tsar,
and the Gray Wolf bade Prince Ivan farewell for
the last time as he dismounted at the great gates.
The prince hurried into the banquet-hall, and there,
looking like some fair statue that had been moulded
from frozen snow, sat beautiful Queen Helen by
Prince Vasili’s side. They had just returned from
the wedding ceremony, and all the nobles were
gathered round.</p>

<p>When Queen Helen saw who had entered the
hall, her speech came back to her, and she flew to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
her lover with a cry of rapture and kissed him on
the lips.</p>

<p>“This is my own dear husband,” she cried. “I
belong to him, and not to the wicked prince I have
married to-day.” From the shelter of Ivan’s breast
she told the old tsar all that had happened, and
how it was to his youngest son that he owed the
gold-maned horse and the Magic Bird.</p>

<p>The joy of the tsar at his favorite son’s return
was tempered by his grief and amazement at the
conduct of the elder princes. They were cast into
prison, where they languish still; but Prince Ivan
and the beautiful Queen Helen are as happy as the
days are long, and the Magic Bird was allowed to
return to her home in the golden West.</p>

<h2 id="KING_ROBERT_OF_SICILY">KING ROBERT OF SICILY</h2>

<p class="author">Retold from the poem by Henry W. Longfellow</p>

<p class="dropcap">King Robert of Sicily was at church one
evening attended as usual by a great train
of gallant knights and trusty squires and ladies
of the court. As he sat proudly in his high place,
dressed in rich and beautiful robes, he thought not
so much of the service as of his own importance
and state. Not only was he a king himself, but
he was brother to the Pope and to Valmond, Emperor
of Germany.</p>

<p>Presently his attention was attracted by the
chant that the priests were singing. It was the
Magnificat. Over and over again they repeated the
words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i lang="la">Deposuit potentes de sede, et exaltavit humiles.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>King Robert had heard the chant many times
before, but now he found himself wondering what
this particular phrase meant. A learned man was
at his side, and the king spoke to him.</p>

<p>“What do those words mean?” he asked.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He has put down the mighty from their seat,</div>
<div class="verse">And has exalted them of low degree,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">replied the scholar.</p>

<p>“It is well that such words are sung in Latin
and only by the priests,” muttered King Robert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
scornfully. “Be it known to both priests and
people that there is no power that can push me
from my throne.”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his seat yawning and soon
fell asleep, lulled by the monotonous chant.</p>

<p>Now, it was St. John’s eve and on that day
strange and unlooked for things happen. When
King Robert awoke from his nap it was night and
he was alone in the church. The service was over
and the priests and every one else except himself
had gone. The great building was dark but for
the little lamps which were kept burning constantly
before the images of the saints.</p>

<p>King Robert started from his seat and looked
around in amazement. All was still. He groped
his way down the long aisle to the door; he took
hold of the handle and tried to turn it; the door
was locked. He called and listened for an answer
but none came. He knocked and he shouted, but
to no purpose. Growing angrier every minute, he
cried out threats and complaints and the sound of
his own voice came back to him echoing from the
roofs and the walls. It was as though he were
being mocked by unseen hearers.</p>

<p>After what seemed a long time, the knocking
and the shouting brought the sexton to the church
door. He came with his lantern suspecting that
thieves were in the church.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” he called.</p>

<p>“Open the door at once,” commanded the king,
who was almost beside himself with rage. “It is
I, the king.”</p>

<p>The sexton trembled and waited to hear more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
before putting the great key in the lock. He
thought that there must be a madman within.</p>

<p>“Art thou afraid?” cried the king.</p>

<p>“It is a drunken vagabond,” muttered the old
man and, turning the key, he flung the door wide
open.</p>

<p>A figure leaped past him in the darkness. It
was King Robert, but the sexton did not dream of
that for the figure was half-naked and forlorn. The
king’s gorgeous robes had disappeared, his hat and
his cloak were gone and he did not look like himself
at all. Without a word or a look at the sexton he
sped down the street.</p>

<p>Bare-headed and breathless and splashed with
mud, Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane
and of Valmond, Emperor of Germany, reached
his palace gate—the gate that he had entered in
triumph so many times.</p>

<p>He thundered for admittance, boiling with rage
and half-mad with an overpowering sense of his
wrongs. Through the gate he rushed and across
the courtyard, thrusting aside every one who stood
in his way, upsetting pages, and overwhelming
guards. Past them all and up the broad stairway
he hurried and then sped through the long halls.
He paid no attention to the calls and the cries
which pursued him, and did not pause until he
reached the banquet room.</p>

<p>There on a dais sat another king wearing
Robert’s robes, his crown and his signet-ring. His
features were like Robert’s and so was his form,
but he possessed a majesty and an exalted look
which the real king lacked. The room, always well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
lighted, shone with an unusual brilliancy and the
atmosphere was full of fragrance.</p>

<p>An Angel had taken the place of the king, and
although no one was conscious of the change every
one present vaguely felt the improvement.</p>

<p>Robert stood speechless before the miracle.
Then his surprise gave way to anger at seeing
another in his place. The Angel spoke first.</p>

<p>“Who art thou, and why comest thou here?” he
asked benignly, meeting Robert’s threatening look
with one of almost divine compassion.</p>

<p>“I am the king,” answered Robert indignantly,
“and I have come to claim my throne from the impostor
who is on it.”</p>

<p>As he stood before the Angel, Robert did not
look at all royal, and his clothing made such a difference
in his appearance that the courtiers did not
notice even a resemblance to their king, and took
him for a stranger. At his bold words they sprang
angrily from their seats and drew their swords to
put him to death for his insolence.</p>

<p>The Angel was unmoved. He signed to the
courtiers to sheath the weapons that they had
drawn in his defense.</p>

<p>“No, thou art not the king,” he said to Robert.
“Thou art the king’s jester and henceforth thou
shalt wear bells and cap and a scalloped cape and
lead a monkey about by a string. Thou shalt obey
my servants and wait on my men.”</p>

<p>In those days every king kept a jester or a fool
whose duty it was to amuse his master and the
court. Often the jester was not quite right in his
mind and for that reason said odd things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
would not have occurred to entirely sane people,
and he was allowed to make speeches which
would have been rebuked if they had come from
others. Thus the Angel treated Robert’s claim
as a jest.</p>

<p>The attendants were delighted with the new
joke. Paying no attention except laughter to
Robert’s cries and explanations, they thrust him
from the banquet hall and down the stairs. A
crowd of pages ran before him throwing the doors
wide open with mock ceremony, while the boisterous
men-at-arms shouted “Long live the King”
with noisy glee.</p>

<p>How he got through the evening King Robert
hardly knew. He was so tired when he was shown
at last to his comfortless straw bed that he slept
better than he had done many a night on his royal
couch.</p>

<p>The next morning he awoke with the day.</p>

<p>“What a curious dream I have had,” he exclaimed
sleepily.</p>

<p>But it was no dream. Straw rustled as he turned
his head and by his side were the cap and bells
which he was to put on. His room was bare, its
walls were discolored, and presently he heard horses
stamping in their near-by stalls. He was in a
stable. The monkey was there, too; King Robert
saw the horrid thing grinning and chattering in a
corner. His past life seemed far away. He had
to begin to live again, this time the butt and the
jest of the palace.</p>

<p>Days came and went, and the Angel still sat on
the throne. The island of Sicily prospered under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
his reign. The crops were good, the vintage was
abundant and the people were happy.</p>

<p>King Robert yielded to fate, but he did not yield
willingly. He became sullen and silent and was a
sorry jester in spite of his gay dress and his jingling
bells and the chattering monkey. The courtiers
mocked him in innumerable ways and the
nimble pages played pranks on him; he had to be
content with scraps from the tables of his masters,
and the monkey was his only friend.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Angel asked him, as though in
jest, “Art thou the king?” and Robert, still defiant,
replied haughtily, “I am, I am the king!”</p>

<p>Almost three years passed. Then messengers
came from Valmond, Emperor of Germany, to tell
King Robert that their brother, Pope Urbane,
summoned him to come on Holy Thursday to his
city, Rome. The Angel welcomed the ambassadors
with fitting ceremony, and gave them magnificent
presents, embroidered vests, velvet mantles, rare
jewels and costly rings. Not only were his guests
messengers from the great Valmond but they were
mighty nobles.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get ready the Angel went
with the ambassadors and a mighty train of followers
over the sea to Italy. As the procession
travelled along crowds gathered to watch its progress.
Never had there been seen a more gorgeous
assembly. The Angel and his courtiers and the
ambassadors were dressed in splendid garments
with gold and gems and laces and embroideries
and velvets and satins and nodding plumes, each
one according to his state, and their horses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
resplendent with gold and silver and jeweled
bridles. After them rode the servants, less fine
but equally gay, and among the lowliest of these
was poor Robert riding in mock state on an awkward
piebald pony. As the ridiculous steed
shambled along, his rider’s cloak of fox-tails
flapped in the wind and his bells jingled. The king
was very unhappy and his face showed it, but it
was only a joke for a jester to look disconsolate
and people were no more sorry for him than for
the solemn monkey who perched demurely by his
side and aped his ways. In all the country towns
through which they went the gaping crowds stared
at them and laughed.</p>

<p>The Pope received the Angel and the emperor
with pomp. Trumpets sounded a welcome and
banners waved joyously, as they met on St. Peter’s
square. The Pope embraced and blessed his
brothers, as he thought, for even he did not
know that he was entertaining an Angel. While
prayers and rejoicing were at their height
Robert the jester burst through the crowd
and rushed into the presence of the Pope and his
guests.</p>

<p>“I am the king,” he cried, addressing the Pope,
“look and behold in me Robert, your brother, King
of Sicily. That man who looks like me and wears
my robes and my crown is an impostor. Do you
not know me? Does nothing tell you that we are
akin?”</p>

<p>Robert was desperate. This seemed his last
chance of regaining his rights. He was appealing
to the highest authority in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pope looked troubled. He turned silently
from Robert to the Angel with searching glances.
The Angel met his scrutiny with perfect serenity.
Valmond only laughed.</p>

<p>“It is strange sport to have a madman for thy
jester,” he said to the Angel, whom he believed to
be his brother.</p>

<p>The baffled jester was hustled back into the
crowd. He was in disgrace and suffered punishment
for his untimely joke.</p>

<p>Holy Week went by in solemn state, and Easter
Sunday came. On that blessed morning the city
was radiant with light even before the sun rose.
The Angel’s presence made Rome bright, and filled
men’s hearts with love and goodness. They felt
as though Christ had indeed risen from the dead
and were ready to devote themselves to him with
fresh zeal. Even the jester, as he opened his eyes
to the marvelous light felt within his heart a power
that he had never felt before. What mattered it
that his bed was straw? He fell on his knees beside
it and prayed to the risen Christ.</p>

<p>When the visit was ended Valmond returned to
Germany and the Angel and his train once more
flashed along the towns of Italy and then set sail
for Sicily. When they reached home the Angel
occupied the throne as before. Robert could not
understand it but he was humbled and no longer
felt angry and bitter.</p>

<p>One evening when the convent bells were ringing
for prayer the Angel beckoned to Robert to draw
near and signed to the attendants to leave the
room. When they were alone the Angel turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to Robert and asked with less sternness than ever
before, “Art thou the king?”</p>

<p>King Robert bowed his head meekly and crossed
his hands upon his breast.</p>

<p>“Thou knowest best,” he said. “I have sinned.
Let me go away from here and spend the rest of
my days in a convent cell. There, kneeling on
stones, I will beg heaven to forgive my pride.”</p>

<p>The Angel smiled and the place was filled with
a heavenly light. At the same moment through
the open windows came the chant of the monks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He has put down the mighty from their seat</div>
<div class="verse">And has exalted them of low degree.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>King Robert understood it at last. Then above
the measured tones of the singers rose another
voice, one of heavenly sweetness. It said:</p>

<p>“I am an Angel, thou art the king.”</p>

<p>The king lifted his eyes. He was alone. No
longer was he dressed in the motley attire of a
jester, but he was in royal robes such as he used to
wear, in velvet and ermine and cloth of gold.</p>

<p>When the courtiers came back to the room they
found their king on his knees, absorbed in silent
prayer.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RIDDLE_OF_THE_SPHINX">THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX</h2>

<p class="author">By Elsie Finnimore Buckley</p>

<p class="dropcap">Long ago, in the city of Thebes, there ruled a
king named Laius and his queen Iocasta.
They were children of the gods, and Thebes itself,
men said, had been built by hands more than mortal;
for Apollo had led Cadmus the Phœnician, the
son of Zeus, to the sacred spot where he was to
raise the citadel of Thebes, and Pallas Athene had
help him to slay the monstrous dragon that
guarded the sacred spring of Ares. The teeth of
the dragon Cadmus took and planted in the plain
of Thebes, and from this seed there sprang up a
great host of armed men, who would have slain
him; but he took a stone and cast it in their midst,
whereupon the serpent men turned their arms one
against another, fighting up and down the plain
till only five were left. With the help of these five,
Cadmus built the citadel of Thebes, and round it
made a wall so wide that a dozen men and more
might walk upon it, and so huge were the stones
and so strong was the masonry that parts of it are
standing to this day.</p>

<p>As for the city itself, the tale goes that Amphion,
the mightiest of all musicians, came with his
lyre, and so sweetly did he play that the hearts of
the very stones were stirred within them, so that
of their own free will they fell into their places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and the town of Thebes rose up beneath the shadow
of the citadel.</p>

<p>For many a long day did Laius and Iocasta rule
over the people of Thebes, and all that time they
had no children; for a dreadful curse lay on the
head of Laius that, if ever he had a son, by that
son’s hand he should die. At last a boy was born
to them, and Laius, remembering the curse, swore
that the child should never grow to manhood, and
he bade Iocasta slay him forthwith. But she, being
his mother, was filled with a great love and pity
for the helpless child. When it nestled in her arms
and clung to her breast she could not find it in her
heart to slay it, and she wept over it many a bitter
salt tear, and pressed it closer to her bosom.</p>

<p>So she called a trusty house slave, who knew the
king’s decree, and placing the child in his arms, she
said: “Go, take it away, and hide it in the hills.
Perchance the gods will have pity on it, and put
it in the heart of some shepherd, who feeds his
flocks on distant pastures, to take the child home
to his cot and rear it. Farewell, my pretty babe.
The green grass must be thy cradle, and the mountain
breezes must lull thee to sleep. May the gods
in their mercy bless thy childhood’s hours, and
make thy name famous among men; for thou art
a king’s son, and a child of the Immortals, and the
Immortals forget not those that are born of their
blood.”</p>

<p>So the man took the child from Iocasta; but,
because he feared the king’s decree, he pierced its
ankles and bound them together, for he thought:
“Surely, even if some shepherd wandering on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
mountainside should light upon the child, he will
never rear one so maimed; and if the king should
ask, I will say that he is dead.”</p>

<p>But because the child wept for the pain in its
ankles, he took it home first to his wife to be fed
and comforted, and when she gave it back into his
arms, it smiled up into his face. Then all the hardness
died out of his heart, for the gods had shed
about it a grace to kindle love in the coldest breast.</p>

<p>Now Cithæron lies midway between Thebes and
Corinth, and in winter-time the snow lies deep upon
the summit, and the wild winds shriek through the
rocks and clefts, and the pine trees pitch and bend
beneath the fury of the blast, so that men called
it the home of the Furies, the awful goddesses, who
track out sin and murder. And there, too, in
the streams and caverns, dwell the naiads and the
nymphs, wild spirits of the rocks and waters, and
if any mortal trespass on their haunts, they drive
him to madness in their echoing grottoes and
gloomy caves. Yet, for all that, though men called
it dark Cithæron, the grass about its feet grew fine
and green, so that the shepherds came from all the
neighboring towns to pasture their flocks on its
well-watered slopes. Here it was that Laius’s
herdsman fell in with a herdsman of Polybus, King
of Corinth, and, seeing that he was a kindly man,
and likely to have compassion on the child, he gave
it to him to rear.</p>

<p>Now, it had not pleased the gods to grant any
children to Polybus, King of Corinth, and Merope,
his wife, though they wreathed their altars with
garlands and burnt sweet savor of incense; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
at last all hope died out of their hearts, and they
said: “The gods are angry, and will destroy our
race, and the kingdom shall pass into the hands
of a stranger.”</p>

<p>But one day it chanced that the queen saw in
the arms of one of her women a child she had not
seen before, and she questioned her, and asked if
it were hers. And the woman confessed that her
husband, the king’s herdsman, had found it on dim
Cithæron, and had taken pity on it, and brought
it home.</p>

<p>Then the queen looked at the child, and seeing
that it was passing fair, she said: “Surely this is
no common babe, but a child of the Immortals.
His hair is golden as the summer corn, and his
eyes like the stars in heaven. What if the gods
have sent him to comfort our old age, and rule the
kingdom when we are dead? I will rear him in
the palace as my own son, and he shall be a prince
in the land of Corinth.”</p>

<p>So the child lived in the palace, and became a
son of Polybus and Merope, and heir to the kingdom.
For want of a name they called him Œdipus,
because his ankles, when they found him, were all
swollen by the pin that the herdsman had put
through them. As he grew up, he found favor in
all men’s eyes, for he was tall and comely and cunning
withal.</p>

<p>“The gods are gracious,” men said, “to grant
the king such a son, and the people of Corinth so
mighty a prince, to rule over them in days to come.”
For as yet they knew not that he was a foundling,
and no true heir to the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, while the child was still young, he played
about the courts of the palace, and in running and
leaping and in feats of strength and hardihood of
heart there was none to beat him among his playmates,
or even to stand up against him, save one.
But so well matched were these two that the other
children would gather round them in a ring to
watch them box and wrestle, and the victor they
would carry on their shoulders round the echoing
galleries with shouting and clapping of hands; and
sometimes it was Œdipus, and sometimes the other
lad. But at length there came a time when again
and again Œdipus was proved the stronger, and
again and again the other slunk home beaten, like
a dog that has been whipped: and he brooded over
his defeat, and nourished hatred in his heart against
Œdipus, and vowed that one day he would have his
revenge by fair means or by foul.</p>

<p>But when Merope the queen saw Œdipus growing
tall and fair, and surpassing all his comrades
in strength, she took him up one day on to the
citadel, and showed him all the lovely land of
Hellas lying at his feet. Below them spread the
shining city, with its colonnades and fountains and
stately temples of the gods, like some jewel of
the golden sands, and far away to the westward
stretched the blue Corinthian Gulf. And she
showed him the hills of Arcadia, the land of song
and shepherds, where Pan plays his pipe beneath
the oak trees, and nymphs and satyrs dance all the
day long. Away to the bleak northwest stood out
the snowy peaks of Mount Parnassus and Helicon,
the home of the Muses, who fill men’s minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
with wisdom and their hearts with the love of all
things beautiful. Then Merope turned him to the
eastward and the land of the Dawning Day, and
showed him the purple peaks of Ægina and the
gleaming Attic shore. And she said to him:
“Œdipus, my son, seest thou how Corinth lies midway
’twixt north and south and east and west, a
link to join the lands together and a barrier to
separate the seas?”</p>

<p>And Œdipus answered: “Of a truth, mother, he
who rules in Corinth hath need of a lion’s heart,
for he must stand ever sword in hand and guard
the passage from north to south.”</p>

<p>“Courage is a mighty thing, my son, but wisdom
is mightier. The sword layeth low, but wisdom
buildeth up. Seest thou the harbors on either side,
facing east and west, and the masts of the ships,
like a forest in winter, and the traffic of sailors and
merchants on the shore? From all lands they come
and bring their wares and merchandise, and men
of every nation meet together. Think not, my son,
that a lion’s heart and a fool’s head therewith can
ever be a match for the wisdom of Egypt or the
cunning of Phœnicia.”</p>

<p>Then Œdipus understood and said: “Till now I
have wrestled and boxed and run races with my
fellows on the sands the livelong day, and none
can beat me. Henceforth I will sit in the market-place
and discourse with foreigners and learned
men, so that, when I come to rule in my father’s
place, I may be the wisest in all the land.”</p>

<p>And Merope was pleased at his answer, but in
her heart she was sad that his simple childish days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were past; and she prayed that if the gods granted
him wisdom they would keep his heart pure and
free from all uncleanness.</p>

<p>So Œdipus sat in the market-place and talked
with merchants and travellers, and he went down
to the ships in the harbor and learned many strange
things of strange lands—the wisdom of the Egyptians,
who were the wisest of all men in the south,
and the cunning of the Phœnicians, who were the
greatest merchants and sailors in all the world.
But in the evening, when the sun was low in the
west, and the hills all turned to amethyst and
sapphire, and the snow mountains blushed ruby
red beneath his parting kiss, then along the smooth,
gold sands of the Isthmus, by the side of the sounding
sea, he would box and wrestle and run, till all
the ways were darkened and the stars stood out in
the sky. For he was a true son of Hellas, and
knew that nine times out of every ten a slack body
and a slack mind go together.</p>

<p>So he grew up in his beauty, a very god for wisdom
and might, and there was no question he could
not answer nor riddle he could not solve, so that all
the land looked up to him, and the king and queen
loved him as their own son.</p>

<p>Now one day there was a great banquet in the
palace, to which all the noblest of the land were
bidden, and the minstrels played and the tumblers
danced and the wine flowed freely round the board,
so that men’s hearts were opened, and they talked
of great deeds and heroes, and boasted what they
themselves could do. And Œdipus boasted as loud
as any, and challenged one and all to meet him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
fair fight. But the youth who had grown up with
him in rivalry, and nourished jealousy and hatred
in his heart, taunted him to his face, and said:
“Base born that thou art, and son of slave, thinkest
thou that free men will fight with thee? Lions
fight not with curs, and though thou clothe thyself
with purple and gold, all men know that thou art
no true son to him thou callest thy sire.”</p>

<p>And this he said being flushed with wine, and
because myriad-mouthed Rumor had spread
abroad the tale that Œdipus was a foundling,
though he himself knew naught thereof.</p>

<p>Then Œdipus flushed red with rage, and swift
as a gale that sweeps down from the mountains he
fell upon the other, and seizing him by the throat,
he shook him till he had not a breath to beg for
mercy. “What sayest thou now, thou whelp?
Begone with thy lying taunt, now that thou hast
licked the dust for thy falsehood.”</p>

<p>And he flung him out from the hall. But
Merope leant pale and sad against a pillar, and
veiled her face in her mantle to hide her tears. And
when they were alone, Œdipus took her hand and
stroked it, and said: “Grieve not for my fiery spirit,
mother, but call me thine own son, and say that I
was right to silence the liar who would cast dishonor
upon my father’s name and upon thee.”</p>

<p>But she looked at him sadly and longingly
through her tears, and spoke in riddling words:
“The gods, my child, sent thee to thy father and
to me in answer to our prayers. A gift of God
thou art, and a gift of God thou shalt be, living
and dead, to them that love thee. The flesh groweth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
old and withereth away as a leaf, but the spirit
liveth on forever, and those are the truest of kin
who are kin in the spirit of goodness and of love.”</p>

<p>But Œdipus was troubled, for she would say no
more, but only held his hand, and when he drew
it away it was wet with her tears. Then he
thought in his heart: “Verily my mother would not
weep for naught. What if, after all, there be something
in the tale? I will go to the central shrine
of Hellas and ask the god of Truth, golden-haired
Apollo. If he say it is a lie, verily I will thrust
it back down that coward’s throat, and the whole
land shall ring with his infamy. And if it be true—the
gods will guide me how to act.”</p>

<p>So he set forth alone upon his pilgrimage.
He drew near to the sacred place and made due
sacrifice, and washed in the great stone basin, and
put away all uncleanness from his heart, and went
through the portals of rock to the awful shrine
within, where the undying fire burns night and day
and the sacred laurel stands. And he put his question
to the god and waited for an answer.</p>

<p>Through the dim darkness of the shrine he saw
the priestess on her tripod, veiled in a mist of incense
and vapor, and as the power of the god came
upon her she beheld the things of the future and
the hidden secrets of Fate. And she raised her
hand toward Œdipus, and with pale lips spoke the
words of doom: “Œdipus ill-fated, thine own sire
shalt thou slay.”</p>

<p>As she spoke the words his head swam round
like a whirlpool, and his heart seemed turned to
stone; then, with a loud and bitter cry, he rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
from the temple, through the thronging crowd of
pilgrims down into the Sacred Way, and the people
moved out of his path like shadows. Blindly
he sped along the stony road, down through the
pass to a place where three roads meet, and he
shuddered as he crossed them; for Fear laid her
cold hand upon his heart and filled it with a wild,
unreasoning dread, and branded the image of that
awful spot upon his brain so that he could never
forget it. On every side the mountains frowned
down upon him, and seemed to echo to and fro the
doom which the priestess had spoken. Straight
forward he went like some hunted thing, turning
neither to right nor left, till he came to a narrow
path, where he met an old man in a chariot drawn
by mules, with his trusty servants round him.</p>

<p>“Ho! there, thou madman!” they shouted;
“stand by and let the chariot pass.”</p>

<p>“Madmen yourselves,” he cried, for his sore
heart could not brook the taunt. “I am a king’s
son, and will stand aside for no man.”</p>

<p>So he tried to push past them by force, though
he was one against many. And the old man
stretched out his hand as though to stop him, but
as well might a child hope to stand up against a
wild bull. For he thrust him aside and felled him
from his seat, and turned upon his followers, and,
striking out to right and left, he stunned one and
slew another, and forced his way through in blind
fury. But the old man lay stiff and still upon the
road. The fall from the chariot had quenched the
feeble spark of life within him, and his spirit fled
away to the house of Hades and the Kingdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the Dead. One trusty servant lay slain by his side,
and the other senseless and stunned, and when he
awoke, to find his master and his comrades slain,
Œdipus was far upon his way.</p>

<p>On and on he went, over hill and dale and
mountain stream, till at length his strength gave
way, and he sank down exhausted. And black
despair laid hold of his heart, and he said within
himself: “Better to die here on the bare hillside
and be food for the kites and crows than return
to my father’s house to bring death to him and
sorrow to my mother’s heart.”</p>

<p>But sweet sleep fell upon him, and when he
awoke hope and the love of life put other thoughts
in his breast. And he remembered the words which
Merope the queen had spoke to him one day when
he was boasting of his strength and skill.</p>

<p>“Strength and skill, my son, are the gifts of the
gods, as the rain which falleth from heaven and
giveth life and increase to the fruits of the earth.
But man’s pride is an angry flood that bringeth
destruction on field and city. Remember that great
gifts may work great good or great evil, and he
who has them must answer to the gods if he use
them well or ill.”</p>

<p>And he thought within himself: “’Twere ill to
die if, even in the uttermost parts of the earth, men
need a strong man’s arm and a wise man’s cunning.
Never more will I return to far-famed Corinth
and my home by the sounding sea, but to
far-distant lands will I go and bring blessing to
those who are not of my kin, since to mine own
folk I must be a curse if ever I return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>So he went along the road from Delphi till he
came to seven-gated Thebes. There he found all
the people in deep distress and mourning, for their
king Laius was dead, slain by robbers on the highroad,
and they had buried him far from his native
land at a place where three roads meet. And,
worse still, their city was beset by a terrible monster,
the Sphinx, part eagle and part lion, with
the face of a woman, who every day devoured a
man because they could not answer the riddle she
set them.</p>

<p>All this Œdipus heard as he stood in the market
place and talked with the people.</p>

<p>“What is this famous riddle that none can solve?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Alas! young man, that none can say. For he
that would solve the riddle must go up alone to
the rock where she sits. Then and there she chants
the riddle, and if he answer it not forthwith she
tears him limb from limb. And if none go up to
try the riddle, then she swoops down upon the city
and carries off her victims, and spares not woman
or child. Our wisest and bravest have gone up,
and our eyes have seen them no more. Now there
is no man left who dare face the terrible beast.”</p>

<p>Then Œdipus said: “I will go up and face this
monster. It must be a hard riddle indeed if I
cannot answer it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, overbold and rash,” they cried, “thinkest
thou to succeed where so many have failed?”</p>

<p>“Better to try, and fail, than never to try at all.”</p>

<p>“Yet, where failure is death, surely a man should
think twice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“A man can die but once, and how better than
in trying to save his fellows?”</p>

<p>As they looked at his strong young limbs and
his fair young face they pitied him. “Stranger,”
they said, “who art thou to throw away thy life
thus heedlessly? Are there none at home to mourn
thee and no kingdom thou shouldst rule? For, of
a truth, thou art a king’s son and no common man.”</p>

<p>“Nay, were I to return, my home would be
plunged in mourning and woe, and the people
would drive me from my father’s house.”</p>

<p>They marveled at his answer, but dared question
him no further; and, seeing that nothing would
turn him from his purpose, they showed him the
path to the Sphinx’s rock, and all the people went
out with him to the gate with prayers and blessings.
At the gate they left him, for he who goes
up to face the Sphinx must go alone, and none can
stand by and help him. So he went through the
Crenean gate and across the stream of Dirce into
the wide plain, and the mountain of the Sphinx
stood out dark and clear on the other side. Then
he prayed to Pallas Athene, the gray-eyed goddess
of Wisdom, and she took all fear from his heart.
So he went up boldly to the rock, where the monster
sat waiting to spring upon her prey; yet for
all his courage his heart beat fast as he looked on
her. For at first she appeared like a mighty bird,
with great wings of bronze and gold, and the glancing
sunbeams played about them, casting a halo
of light around, and in the midst of the halo her
face shone out pale and beautiful as a star at dawn.
But when she saw him coming near, a greedy fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
lit up her eyes, and she put out her cruel claws and
lashed her tail from side to side like an angry lion
waiting for his prey. Nevertheless, Œdipus spoke
to her fair and softly: “Oh, lady, I am come to
hear thy famous riddle and answer it or die.”</p>

<p>“Foolhardy manling, a dainty morsel the gods
have sent this day, with thy fair young face and
fresh young limbs.” And she licked her cruel lips.</p>

<p>Then Œdipus felt his blood boil within him, and
he wished to slay her then and there; for she who
had been the fairest of women was now the foulest
of beasts, and he saw that by her cruelty she had
killed the woman’s soul within her, and the soul of
a beast had taken its place.</p>

<p>“Come, tell me thy famous riddle, foul Fury that
thou art, that I may answer it and rid the land of
this curse.”</p>

<p>“At dawn it creeps on four legs; at noon it
strides on two; at sunset and evening it totters on
three. What is this thing, never the same, yet not
many, but one?” So she chanted slowly, and her
eyes gleamed cruel and cold.</p>

<p>Then thought Œdipus within himself: “Now or
never must my learning and wit stand me in good
stead, or in vain have I talked with the wisest of
men and learnt the secrets of Phœnicia and Egypt.”</p>

<p>And the gods who had given him understanding
sent light into his heart, and boldly he answered:
“What can this creature be but man, O Sphinx?
For, a helpless babe at the dawn of life, he crawls
on his hands and feet; at noontide he walks erect
in the strength of his manhood; and at evening he
supports his tottering limbs with a staff, the prop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and stay of old age. Have I not answered aright
and guessed thy famous riddle?”</p>

<p>Then with a loud cry of despair, and answering
him never a word, the great beast sprang up from
her seat on the rock and hurled herself over the
precipice into the yawning gulf beneath. Far away
across the plain the people heard her cry, and they
saw the flash of the sun on her brazen wings like
a gleam of lightning in the summer sky. Thereupon
they sent up a great shout of joy to heaven,
and poured out from every gate into the open plain,
and some raised Œdipus upon their shoulders, and
with shouts and songs of triumph bore him to the
city. Then and there they made him king with
one accord, for the old king had left no son behind
him, and who more fitted to rule over them than the
slayer of the Sphinx and the savior of their city?</p>

<p>So Œdipus became King of Thebes, and wisely
and well did he rule, and for many a long year the
land prospered both in peace and war.</p>

<p>But the day came when a terrible pestilence
broke out, and the people died by hundreds, so
that at last Œdipus sent messengers to Delphi to
ask why the gods were angry and had sent a
plague upon the land. And this was the answer
they brought back: “There is an unclean thing in
Thebes. Never has the murderer of Laius been
found, and he dwells a pollution in the land.
Though the vengeance of the gods is slow, yet it
cometh without fail, and the shedding of blood
shall not pass unpunished.”</p>

<p>Then Œdipus made proclamation through the
land that if any man knew who the murderer was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
they should give him up to his doom and appease
the anger of Heaven. And he laid a terrible curse
on any who dared to give so much as a crust of
bread or a draft of water to him who had brought
such suffering on the land. So throughout the
country far and wide a search was made to track
out the stain of blood and cleanse the city from
pollution, but day after day the quest was fruitless,
and the pestilence raged unceasingly, and
darkness fell upon the soul of the people, as their
prayers remained unanswered and their burnt-offerings
smoked in vain upon the altars of the
gods. Then at last Œdipus sent for the blind
seer Teiresias, who had lived through six generations
of mortal men, and was the wisest of all
prophets on earth. He knew the language of the
birds, and, though his eyes were closed in darkness,
his ears were opened to hear the secrets of
the universe, and he knew the hidden things of the
past and of the future. But at first when he came
before the king he would tell him nothing, but
begged him to question no further. “For the
things of the future will come of themselves,” he
cried, “though I shroud them in silence, and evil
will it be for thee, O king, and evil for thine house
if I speak out the knowledge that is hidden in my
heart.”</p>

<p>At last Œdipus grew angry at his silence, and
taunted him: “Verily, methinks thou thyself didst
aid in the plotting of this deed, seeing that thou
carest naught for the people bowed down beneath
the pestilence and the dark days that are fallen
on the land, so be it thou canst shield the murderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and escape thyself from the curse of the
gods.”</p>

<p>Then Teiresias was stung past bearing, and
would hold his tongue no longer. “By thine own
doom shalt thou be judged, O king,” he said.
“Thou thyself art the murderer, thyself the pollution
that staineth the land with the blood of innocent
men.”</p>

<p>Then Œdipus laughed aloud: “Verily, old man,
thou pratest. What rival hath urged thee to this
lie, hoping to drive me from the throne of Thebes?
Of a truth, not thine eyes only, but thy heart, is
shrouded in a mist of darkness.”</p>

<p>“Woe to thee, Œdipus, woe to thee! Thou hast
sight, yet seest not who thou art, nor knowest the
deed of thine hand. Soon shalt thou wander sightless
and blind, a stranger in a strange land, feeling
the ground with a staff, and men shall shrink back
from thee in horror when they hear thy name and
the deed that thou hast done.”</p>

<p>And the people were hushed by the words of the
old man, and knew not what to think. But the
wife of Œdipus, who stood by his side, said:
“Hearken not to him, my lord. For verily no
mortal can search the secrets of Fate, as I can
prove full well by the words of this same man that
he spoke in prophecy. For he it was who said that
Laius, the king who is dead, should be slain by the
hand of his own son. However, that poor innocent
never grew to manhood, but was exposed on the
trackless mountainside to die of cold and hunger;
and Laius, men say, was slain by robber bands at
a place where three roads meet. So hearken not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to seer-craft, ye people, nor trust in the words of
one who is proved a false prophet.”</p>

<p>But her words brought no comfort to Œdipus,
and a dreadful fear came into his heart, like a cold,
creeping snake, as he listened. For he thought of
his journey from Delphi, and of how in his frenzy
he had struck down an old man and his followers
at a place where three roads meet. When he questioned
her further, the time and the place and the
company all tallied, save only that rumor had it
that Laius had been slain by robber bands, while
he had been single-handed against many.</p>

<p>“Was there none left,” he asked, “who saw the
deed and lived to tell the tale?”</p>

<p>“Yea, one faithful follower returned to bear the
news, but so soon as the Sphinx was slain and the
people had made thee king he went into distant
pastures with his flocks, for he could not brook to
see a stranger in his master’s place, albeit he had
saved the land from woe.”</p>

<p>“Go, summon him,” said Œdipus. “If the murderers
were many, as rumor saith, with his aid we
may track them out; but if he was one man single-handed—yea,
though that man were myself—of a
truth he shall be an outcast from the land, that the
plague may be stayed from the people. Verily, my
queen, my heart misgives me when I remember
my wrath and the deed that I wrought at the cross-roads.”</p>

<p>In vain she tried to comfort him, for a nameless
fear had laid hold of his heart.</p>

<p>Now, while they were waiting for the herdsman
to come, a messenger arrived in haste from Corinth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to say that Polybus was dead, and that Œdipus
was chosen king of the land, for his fame had gone
out far and wide as the slayer of the Sphinx and
the wisest of the kings of Hellas.</p>

<p>When Œdipus heard the news, he bowed his
head in sorrow to hear of the death of the father
he had loved, and turning to the messenger, he said,
“For many a long year my heart hath yearned
toward him who is dead, and verily my soul is
grieved that I shall see him no more in the pleasant
light of the sun. But for the oracle’s sake I stayed
in exile, that my hand might not be red with a
father’s blood. And now I thank the gods that he
has passed away in a green old age, in the fullness
of years and of honor.” But the messenger wondered
at his words. “Knewest thou not, then, that
Polybus was no father to thee in the flesh, but that
for thy beauty and thy strength he chose thee out
of all the land to be a son to him and heir to the
kingdom of Corinth?”</p>

<p>“What sayest thou, bearer of ill news that thou
art?” cried Œdipus. “To prove that same tale of
thine a slanderous lie I went to Delphi, and there
the priestess prophesied that I should slay mine
own sire. Wherefore I went not back to my native
land, but have lived in exile all my days.”</p>

<p>“Then in darkness of soul hast thou lived, O king.
For with mine own hands I received thee as a babe
from a shepherd on dim Cithæron, from one of the
herdsmen of Laius, who was king before thee in
this land.”</p>

<p>“Woe is me, then! The curse of the gods is over
me yet. I know not my sire, and unwittingly I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
slay him and rue the evil day. And a cloud of
darkness hangeth over me for the slaying of King
Laius. But lo! they bring the herdsman who saw
the deed done, and pray Heaven he may clear me
from all guilt. Bring him forward that I may
question him.”</p>

<p>Then they brought the man forward before the
king, though he shrank back and tried to hide himself.
When the messenger from Corinth saw him
he started back in surprise, for it was the very man
from whose hands he had taken Œdipus on the
mountainside. And he said to the king, “Behold
the man who will tell thee the secret of thy birth.
From his hands did I take thee as a babe on dim
Cithæron.”</p>

<p>Then Œdipus questioned the man, and at first he
denied it from fear, but at last he was fain to confess.
“And who gave me to thee to slay on the
barren mountainside?”</p>

<p>“I pray thee, my king, ask no more. Some things
there are that are better unsaid.”</p>

<p>“Nay, tell me, and fear not. I care not if I am a
child of shame and slavery stains my birth. A son
of Fortune the gods have made me, and have given
me good days with evil. Speak out, I pray thee.
Though I be the son of a slave, I can bear it.”</p>

<p>“No son of a slave art thou, but seed of a royal
house. Ask no more, my king.”</p>

<p>“Speak, speak, man. Thou drivest me to anger,
and I will make thee tell, though it be by force.”</p>

<p>“Ah! lay not cruel hands upon me. For thine
own sake I would hide it. From the queen thy
mother I had thee, and thy father was—Laius the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
king. At the cross-roads from Delphi didst thou
meet him in his chariot, and slew him unwittingly
in thy wrath. Ah, woe is me! For the gods have
chosen me out to be an unwilling witness to the
truth of their oracles.”</p>

<p>Then a great hush fell upon all the people like
the lull before a storm. For the words of the herdsman
were so strange and terrible that at first they
could scarce take in their meaning. But when they
understood that Œdipus was Laius’s own son, and
that he had fulfilled the dreadful prophecy and
slain his sire, a great tumult arose, some saying one
thing and some another; but the voice of Œdipus
was heard above the uproar, “Ah, woe is me, woe
is me! The curse of the gods is upon me, and none
can escape their wrath. Blindly have I done this
evil, and when I was striving to escape Fate caught
me in her hidden meshes. Oh, foolish hearts of
men, to think that ye can flee from the doom of
the gods; for lo! ye strive in the dark, and your
very struggles bind you but closer in the snare of
your fate. Cast me from the land, ye people; do
with me what ye will. For the gods have made me
a curse and a pollution, and by my death alone
will the land have rest from pestilence.”</p>

<p>And the people would have taken him at his
word; for fickle is the heart of the multitude, and
swayed this way and that by every breath of
calamity.</p>

<p>They were sore stricken, too, by the pestilence,
and in their wrath against the cause of it they
forgot the slaying of the Sphinx and the long
days of peace and prosperity. But the blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
seer Teiresias rose up in their midst, and at his
voice the people were silent.</p>

<p>“Citizens of Cadmus, foolish and blind of heart!
Will ye slay the savior of your city? Have ye forgotten
the man-devouring Sphinx and the days of
darkness? Verily prosperity blunteth the edge of
gratitude. And thou, Œdipus, curse not the gods
for thine evil fate. He that putteth his finger in
the fire is burnt, whether he do it knowingly or not.
As to thy sire, him indeed didst thou slay in ignorance
but the shedding of man’s blood be upon
thine own head, for that was the fruit of thy wrathful
spirit, which, through lack of curbing, broke
forth like an angry beast. Hadst thou never slain
a man, never wouldst thou have slain thy sire. But
now thou art a pollution to the land of thy birth,
and by long exile and wandering must thou expiate
thy sin and die a stranger in a strange land. Yet
methinks that in the dark mirror of prophecy I
see thy form, as it were, a guardian to the land of
thy last resting-place, and in a grove of sacred trees
thy spirit’s lasting habitation, when thy feet have
accomplished the ways of expiation and the days of
thy wandering are done.”</p>

<p>So the people were silenced. But Œdipus would
not be comforted, and in his shame and misery he
put out his own eyes because they had looked on
unspeakable things. Then he clothed himself in
rags and took a pilgrim’s staff, to go forth alone
upon his wanderings. And the people were glad at
his going, because the plague had hardened their
hearts, and they cared nothing for his gray hairs
and sightless eyes, nor remembered all he had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
for them, but thought only how the plague might
be stayed. Even Eteocles and Polynices, his own
sons, showed no pity, but would have let him go
forth alone, that they might live on the fatness of
the land. For their hardness of heart they were
punished long after, when they quarreled as to
which should be king, and brought down the flood
of war upon Thebes, and fell each by the other’s
hand in deadly strife. Of all his children, Antigone
alone refused to let him go forth a solitary
wanderer, and would listen to none of his entreaties
when he spoke of the hardness of the way that
would lie before them.</p>

<p>“Nay, father,” she cried; “thinkest thou that I
could suffer thee to wander sightless and blind in
thine old age with none to stay thy feeble steps or
lend thee the light of their eyes?”</p>

<p>“The road before us is hard and long, my child,
and no man can say when my soul shall find rest.
The ways of the world are cruel, and men love not
the cursed of the gods. As for thee, Heaven bless
thee for thy love; but thou art too frail and tender
a thing to eat of the bread and drink of the waters
of sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Ah, father, thinkest thou that aught could be
more bitter than to sit in the seat of kings while
thou wanderest a beggar on the face of the earth?
Nay, suffer me to go with thee, and stay thy steps
in the days of thy trial.”</p>

<p>Nothing he could say would dissuade her. So
they two set out alone upon their wanderings, the
old man bowed down beneath the weight of sorrow,
and the young girl in the freshness of youth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
beauty, with a great love in her heart—a bright,
burning love which was the light by which she lived,
and a light which never led her astray.</p>

<p>At first Œdipus was filled with shame and bitterness,
and cursed the day of his birth and his
evil fate; but as time went on he remembered the
words of Teiresias—how at his death he should be
a blessing to the land of his last resting-place; and
the hope sprang up in his heart that the gods had
not forsaken him, but would wipe out the stain of
his sin, and make his name once more glorious
among men. Daily this hope grew stronger and
brighter, and he felt that the days of wandering
and expiation were drawing to a close, and a mysterious
power guided his steps he knew not whither,
except that it was toward the goal of his release.
And many a hero’s grave did they pass and many a
sacred shrine, for all along that road men of old
raised monuments to the undying glory of the dead
and the heritage of honor which they left to unborn
generations. And always Antigone tended the old
man’s feeble steps, and lent him the light of her
young eyes, till at length they came to white
Colonus and the grove of the Eumenides. There
she set him on a rock to rest his weary limbs. And
the soft spring breezes played about them, and the
clear waters of Cephisus flowed sparkling at their
feet to the fertile plain below. In the dark coverts
and green glades the nightingale trilled her sweet
song, and the grass was bright with many a golden
crocus and white narcissus bloom. As he sat there
a great calm filled the old man’s heart, for he felt
that the days of his wandering were done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>But while they were resting a man from the
village happened to pass, and when he saw them
he shouted out, “Ho! there, impious wanderers,
know ye not that ye sit on sacred land and trespass
on hallowed ground?”</p>

<p>Then Œdipus knew more surely than ever that
the day of his release had come. “Oh, stranger!”
he cried, “welcome is that which thou sayest. For
here shall the words of the prophet be fulfilled,
when he said that in a grove of sacred trees my
spirit should find rest.”</p>

<p>But the man was not satisfied, and he called to
a band of his countrymen who were in the fields
close by. And they came up and spoke roughly
to Œdipus, and asked his name and business.
When he told them they were filled with horror, for
all men had heard of the slaying of Laius, and they
would have turned him out by force.</p>

<p>But Œdipus raised himself from the rock on
which he was seated, and in spite of his beggar’s
rags and sightless eyes, there was a majesty about
his face and form that marked him as no common
man. “Men of Colonus,” he said, “ye judge by the
evil I have done, and not by the good. Have ye
forgotten the days when the name of Œdipus was
honored throughout the land? Of a truth the
days of darkness came, and the stain of my sin
found me out. But now is my wrathful spirit
curbed, and the gods will make me once more a
blessing to men. Go, tell your king Theseus, who
rules in Athena’s sacred citadel, that Œdipus is
here, and bid him come with all speed if he would
win a guardian for this land, an everlasting safeguard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
for his city in the days of storm and
stress.”</p>

<p>So they sent off a messenger in hot haste, for
there was a mysterious power about the aged wanderer
that none could withstand. And soon
Theseus arrived, himself a mighty hero, who had
made Athens a great city and rid the country of
many a foul pestilence. And he greeted Œdipus
courteously and kindly, as befitted a great prince,
and offered him hospitality.</p>

<p>But Œdipus said, “The hospitality I crave, O
king, is for no brief sojourn in this land. Nay, ’tis
an everlasting home I ask. For the hand of Heaven
is upon me, and full well I know that this day my
soul shall leave this frail and broken body. And
to thee alone is it given to know where my bones
shall rest—to thee and thy seed after thee. As long
as my bones shall remain in the land, so long shall
my spirit watch over it, and men shall call upon my
name to turn the tide of battle and stay the flood
of pestilence and war. Wilt thou come with me,
O king, whither the gods shall lead, and learn the
secret of my grave?”</p>

<p>Then Theseus bowed his head, and answered,
“Show thou the way, and I will come.”</p>

<p>So Œdipus turned and led the way into the
grove, and Theseus and Antigone followed after.
For a mysterious power seemed to guide him, and
he walked as one who could see, and his steps were
strong and firm as those of a man in his prime.
Straight into the grove did he go till they came
to the heart of the wood, where there was a sacred
well beneath a hollow pear-tree. Close by was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
great chasm going deep down into the bowels of
the earth, and men called it the Gate of Hades, the
Kingdom of the Dead.</p>

<p>When they reached the well, Œdipus sat down
upon a rock and called his daughter to his side, and
said, “Antigone, my child, thy hand hath ministered
to me in exile, and smoothed the path for the
wanderer’s feet. Go now, fetch water, and pour
libation and drink-offering to the gods below. It
is the last thing thou canst do for me on earth.”</p>

<p>So Antigone fetched water from the well, and
dressed and tended him, and poured libation to
the gods.</p>

<p>And when she had finished, Œdipus drew her to
him and kissed her tenderly, and said, “Grieve not
for me, my child. Well I know that thy heart will
ache, for love hath made light the burden of toil.
But for me life’s day is done, and I go to my rest.
Do thou seek thy brethren, and be to them as thou
hast been to me. My child, my child, hard is the
way that lies before thee, and my soul yearneth
over thee for the evil day that shall come. But look
thou to thine own pure heart, on which the gods
have set the seal of truth that changeth not with
passing years, and heed not the counsels of men.”</p>

<p>And he held her closely to him, and she clung
weeping about his neck. As they sat a hush fell
upon the grove, and the nightingales ceased their
song, and from the depths of the grove a voice was
heard like the voice of distant thunder. “Œdipus,
Œdipus, why dost thou tarry?”</p>

<p>When they heard it they were afraid. But
Œdipus rose up and gently put his daughter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
him, saying, “Lo! the voice of Zeus, who calleth me.
Fare thee well, my child; thou canst go no further
with me. For Theseus only is it meet to see the
manner of my death, and he and I must go forward
alone into the wood.”</p>

<p>With firm, unfaltering steps he led the way once
more, and Theseus followed after. And what
happened there none can tell, for Theseus kept the
secret to his dying day. But men say that when he
came out of the wood his face was as the face of one
who had seen things passing mortal speech.</p>

<p>As for Œdipus, the great twin Brethren Sleep
and Death carried his bones to Athens, where the
people built him a shrine, and for many a long year
they honored him as a hero in the land of Attica.
For though the sin that he sinned in his wrath and
ignorance was great and terrible, yet his life had
brought joy to many men and prosperity to more
lands than one. For with wisdom and love he
guided his days, and with sorrow and tears he wiped
out the stain of his sin, so that, in spite of all he
suffered, men love to tell of the glory and wisdom
of Œdipus, and of how he solved the riddle of the
Sphinx.</p>

<h2 id="THE_GIFT_OF_ATHENE">THE GIFT OF ATHENE<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h2>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">Near the banks of the stream Kephisos, Erechtheus
had built a city in a rocky and thin-soiled
land. He was the father of a free and brave
people; and though his city was proud and humble,
yet Zeus by his wisdom foresaw that one day it
would become the noblest of all cities throughout
the wide earth, and there was a quarrel between
Poseidon the lord of the sea and Athene the child
of Zeus, to see by whose name the city of Erechtheus
should be called. So Zeus appointed a day
in the which he would judge between them in
presence of the great gods who dwell on high
Olympus.</p>

<p>When the day was come, the gods sat each on
his golden throne on the banks of the stream
Kephisos. High above all was the throne of Zeus,
the great father of gods and men, and by his side
sat Here the queen. This day even the sons of men
might gaze upon them, for Zeus had laid aside his
lightnings, and all the gods had come down in
peace to listen to his judgment between Poseidon
and Athene. There sat Phœbus Apollo with his
golden harp in his hand. His face glistened for
the brightness of his beauty; but there was no anger
in his gleaming eyes, and idle by his side lay the
unerring spear with which he smites all who deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
falsely and speak lies. There beside him sat Artemis,
his sister, whose days were spent in chasing
the beasts of the earth and in sporting with the
nymphs on the reedy banks of Eurotas. There by
the side of Zeus sat Hermes ever bright and youthful,
the spokesman of the gods, with staff in hand
to do the will of the great father. There sat Hephaistos
the lord of fire, and Hestia who guards
the hearth. There, too, was Ares, who delights in
war; and Dionysos, who loves the banquet and the
wine-cup, and Aphrodite, who rose from the sea-foam
to fill the earth with laughter and woe.</p>

<p>Before them all stood the great rivals, awaiting
the judgment of Zeus. High in her left hand,
Athene held the invincible spear; and on her shield,
hidden from mortal sight, was the face on which no
man may gaze and live. Close beside her, proud
in the greatness of his power, Poseidon waited the
issue of the contest. In his right hand gleamed the
trident with which he shakes the earth and cleaves
the waters of the sea.</p>

<p>Then from his golden seat rose the spokesman
Hermes, and his clear voice sounded over all the
great council. “Listen,” he said, “to the will of Zeus,
who judges now between Poseidon and Athene.
The city of Erechtheus shall bear the name of that
god who shall bring forth out of the earth the best
gift for the sons of men. If Poseidon do this, the
city shall be called Poseidonia; but if Athene brings
the higher gift, it shall be called Athens.”</p>

<p>Then King Poseidon rose up in the greatness
of his majesty, and with his trident he smote the
earth where he stood. Straightway the hill was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
shaken to its depths, and the earth split asunder,
and forth from the chasm leaped a horse, such as
never shall be seen again for strength and beauty.
His body shone white all over as the driven snow;
his mane streamed proudly in the wind as he
stamped on the ground and scoured in very wantonness
over hill and valley. “Behold my gift,”
said Poseidon, “and call the city after my name.
Who shall give aught better than the horse to the
sons of man?”</p>

<p>But Athene looked steadfastly at the gods with
her keen gray eye; and she stooped slowly down to
the ground, and planted in it a little seed which
she held in her right hand. She spake no word,
but still gazed calmly on that great council. Presently
they saw springing from the earth a little
germ, which grew up and threw out its boughs and
leaves. Higher and higher it rose, with all its
thick green foliage, and put forth fruit on its clustering
branches. “My gift is better, O Zeus,” she
said, “than that of King Poseidon. The horse
which he has given shall bring war and strife and
anguish to the children of men; my olive tree is
the sign of peace and plenty, of health and
strength, and the pledge of happiness and freedom.
Shall not, then, the city of Erechtheus be
called after my name?” Then with one accord rose
the voices of the gods in the air, as they cried out,
“The gift of Athene is the best which may be given
to the sons of men; it is the token that the city of
Erechtheus shall be greater in peace than in war,
and nobler in its freedom than its power. Let the
city be called Athens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Zeus, the mighty son of Kronos, bowed
his head in sign of judgment that the city should
be called by the name of Athene. From his head
the immortal locks streamed down, and the earth
trembled beneath his feet as he rose from his
golden throne to return to the halls of Olympus.
But still Athene stood gazing over the land which
was now her own; and she stretched out her spear
toward the city of Erechtheus, and said: “I have
won the victory and here shall be my home. Here
shall my children grow up in happiness and freedom;
and hither shall the sons of men come to
learn of law and order. Here shall they see what
great things may be done by mortal hands when
aided by the gods who dwell on Olympus; and
when the torch of freedom has gone out at Athens,
its light shall be handed on to other lands, and men
shall learn that my gift is still the best, and they
shall say that reverence for law and the freedom
of thought and deed has come to them from the
city of Erechtheus, which bears the name of
Athene.”</p>

<h2 id="DAPHNE_CHILD_OF_THE_MORNING">DAPHNE, CHILD OF THE MORNING</h2>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the vale of Tempe, where the stream of Peneios
flows beneath the heights of Olympus towards
the sea, the beautiful Daphne passed the
days of her happy childhood. She climbed the crags
to greet the first rays of the rising sun, and when he
had driven his fiery horses over the sky, she watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
his chariot sink behind the western mountains.
Over hill and dale she roamed, free and light as the
breeze of spring. Other maidens round her spoke
each of her love, but Daphne cared not to listen to
the voice of man, though many a one sought her to
be his wife.</p>

<p>One day, as she stood on the slopes of Ossa in
the glow of early morning, she saw before her a
glorious form. The light of the new-risen sun fell
on his face with a golden splendor, and she knew
that it was Phœbus Apollo. Hastily he ran towards
her, and said, “I have found thee, Child of
the Morning. Others thou hast cast aside, but
from me thou canst not escape. I have sought thee
long, and now will I make thee mine.” But the
heart of Daphne was bold and strong; and her
cheek flushed and her eye sparkled with anger, as
she said, “I know neither love nor bondage. I live
free among the streams and hills; and to none will
I yield my freedom.” Then the face of Apollo
grew dark with anger, and he drew near to seize
the maiden; but swift as the wind she fled away.
Over hill and dale, over crag and river, the feet of
Daphne fell lightly as falling leaves in autumn;
but nearer yet came Phœbus Apollo, till at last the
strength of the maiden began to fail. Then she
stretched out her hands, and cried for help to the
goddess Ceres; but she came not to her aid. Her
head was dizzy, and her limbs trembled in utter
feebleness as she drew near to the broad river
which gladdens the plains of Thessaly. She almost
felt the breath of Phœbus, and her robe was almost
in his grasp. With a wild cry, she said, “Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Peneios, receive thy child,” and she rushed into the
stream, whose waters closed gently over her.</p>

<p>She was gone; and Apollo mourned for his madness
in chasing thus the free maiden. And he said,
“I have punished myself by my folly; the light of
the morning is taken out of the day. I must go on
alone till my journey shall draw towards its end.”
Then he spake the word, and a laurel came up on
the bank where Daphne had plunged into the
stream; and the green bush with its thick clustering
leaves keeps her name forever.</p>

<h2 id="THE_VENGEANCE_OF_APOLLO">THE VENGEANCE OF APOLLO</h2>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the cool evening time King Darius walked in
his royal garden, and the noblest of the Persians
were around him. Then came there a messenger
from the western land in haste and said, “O
king, the men of Athens with the sons of Javan
have taken the city of Sardes, and the temple of
the great goddess Kybele has been burnt.” And
King Darius answered quickly and said, “What
sayest thou, O messenger, that men of whom I
have never heard the name, have come with my
slaves against the land of the great king?” Then
he bade them bring a bow and arrows; and while
some one went for them, the Persians stood round
him in silence, for they feared to speak while the
king was angry. He took the bow, fitted an arrow
to it and shot it up into the sky, and prayed, “O Jupiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that dwellest in the high heavens, suffer me
to be avenged upon the men of Athens. The sons
of Javan are my slaves, and sorely shall they be
smitten for the deeds which they have done.” Then
he gave command, and each day, when the banquet
was spread in the gilded hall and the king sat down
to meat, there stood forth one who said with a loud
voice, “O king, forget not the men of Athens.”</p>

<p>But Jupiter hearkened not to the prayer of the
great king, for the ships were made ready, and his
chieftains and warriors hastened away to the
Athenian land and fought in Marathon. They
fared not well in the battle, for the men of Athens
strove mightily for their country. So in great fear
the Persians fled to the seashore, while the men of
Athens slew them on the land and in the water as
they struggled to reach the ships. And when the
fight was over, they spoiled the Persians who lay
dead on the seashore and took rich plunder, for
scattered about they found embroidered turbans
and bright swords and daggers, and golden bits
and bridles, and silken robes and jewels.</p>

<p>Thus sped the hosts of King Darius; and the
messenger came again in haste, as he sat on his
golden throne in Susa, while the nobles of Persia
did obeisance before him. Then the king said,
“Speak, O man, hast thou brought good tidings
that my slaves have chastised the people of the
strange city?” And the messenger answered, saying,
“O King, the men of Athens have slain thy
mighty men with the sword, and burned thy ships;
and few come back of all the great army which
thou didst send against them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Great and fierce was the wrath of King Darius
when he heard the tidings, and he hastened to make
ready ships and men and horses, that he might go
forth himself against the men of Athens. Then in
every city of the Persian land was heard the noise
as of men who have a great work to do; and the
armorers wrought spears and swords and shields,
and in the harbors they built countless ships to
sail over the dark sea. But Jupiter hearkened not
yet to the prayer of the king; so Darius died, and
Xerxes his son sat upon his throne, and the chief
men of the Persians were gathered round him.
Then the king spake and said, “Be ready, O Persians,
every one of you, for I will go forth with all
my great power, and make slaves of the men of
Athens; and so may the gods do to me, and more
also, if I burn not the temples of their gods with
fire, and bring not hither the golden treasures which
lie in the house of Phœbus Apollo at Delphi.”</p>

<p>Then, with all his great hosts, King Xerxes set
forth from Susa, and his governors and warriors
and slaves followed him, with a great multitude of
every nation and people; and they crossed over
from the land of Asia by a bridge which was built
over the sea of Helle. Thus they journeyed on in
pomp and glory, and King Xerxes thought that
they had done great things when his host slew
Leonidas and three hundred men of Sparta who
guarded the passes of Thermopylæ. So his heart
was filled with pride, and he chose out the bravest
of his warriors, and charged the men of Thessaly
to lead them to Delphi and the temple of Phœbus
Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>There was great fear and terror in Delphi. A
messenger came and said, “The hosts of King
Xerxes are coming to slay the men of this land and
take away the treasures which lie in the house of
King Apollo.” So the Delphians went in great sorrow
to the temple, and bowed their heads to the
earth and prayed, saying, “Child of the light, who
dwellest here in thy holy temple, thieves and robbers
are coming against us, and they are purposed
to take away thy sacred treasures; tell us, then,
what we shall do, for at thy bidding we are ready
to bury them deep in the earth till the storm of
war be overpast.” Then came there a voice from
the inmost shrine, but it was not the voice of the
priestess, for Phœbus Apollo himself came down
to speak his will, and said, “Move them not, men
of Delphi. I will guard my holy place, and none
shall lay hand on my sacred things.”</p>

<p>So they went away in gladness of heart, and
made ready for the coming of the Persians. All
the men of Delphi left the city, saving only sixty
men and the prophet Aceratos, and these sat down
before the steps of the temple. In silence they
waited till the Persians should come, and they marvelled
at the great stillness on the earth and in the
heaven. There was not a cloud in the sky, and the
two peaks of Parnassus glistened in the blazing
sunshine. Not a breath lifted the green leaves of
the sacred laurels, not a bird sang in the breathless
air. Presently, as he turned round to look, the
prophet saw the sacred weapons of Phœbus, which
no mortal man might touch, lying on the temple
steps; and he said to the sixty men who tarried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
with him, “Lo, now will Phœbus fight for his holy
temple, for his own hand hath made ready the
weapons for the battle.”</p>

<p>Soon in the deep valley and along the bank of
the Castalian stream were seen the hosts of the
Persians, as they came on with their long spears
flashing in the bright sunshine. Far away the men
of Delphi saw the blaze of their burnished armor,
and heard the tramp of their war-horses. Onward
they came, and they said one to another, “The gods
have fought for us, and the prize is won already.
See, yonder is the home of Phœbus, and none remain
of the men of Delphi to do battle for his holy
temple.”</p>

<p>Still the sun shone without a cloud in the sky, and
no breeze broke the stillness of the laurel groves.
Still glistened the sacred arms as they lay on the
steps of the temple, and the opened doors showed
the golden treasures which were stored up within.
There lay the throne of Midas, and the golden lion
of Crœsus. There lay the mighty mixing bowl, all
of pure gold, which at the bidding of Crœsus was
wrought by the Samian Theodoros. There lay all
the rich gifts which the men of Hellas had offered
up to win the favor of the lord Apollo.</p>

<p>Then the leaders of the Persians stretched forth
their hands, as though all these things were given
up to them by the god who had forsaken his people;
but even as they came near his holy ground, the
lightning flashed forth, and the crash of the thunder
was heard in the blue heaven, and the dark
cloud fell on the peaks of Parnassus. Like the roar
of a raging torrent, the mighty wind burst forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Down from the steps of the Delphian hill thundered
the huge rocks, and trees uptorn from their
roots were hurled on the hosts of the barbarians.
Louder and fiercer grew the din. Cries and shoutings
were heard from the Alean chapel, for the
virgin Minerva fought against the men of Xerxes.
Smitten by the fiery lightnings, they fell on the
quaking earth. Suddenly there was heard a sound
more fierce and terrible, and two cliffs were hurled
down from the mountain-top. Underneath this
huge mass the mightiest of the Persians lay still
in the sleep of death; and all who yet lived fled
with quaking hearts and trembling steps from the
great wrath of the lord Apollo.</p>

<p>So fought the god for his holy temple. When
from their hiding places the men of Delphi saw that
the Persians fled they poured forth from the caves
and thickets to slay them. They smote them as
sheep are slain before the altar of sacrifice, for even
the bravest of their warriors lifted not their arms
against them. Long time they followed after them
in hot haste; and among them were seen two giant
forms, clothed in bright armor, smiting down the
hosts of the enemy. Then they knew that Phylacos
and Autonoös, the heroes of the place, had come
forth to aid them, and they smote the Persians
more fiercely till the going down of the sun.</p>

<p>So the fight was ended; and the stars came forth
in the cloudless sky, and the laurel groves were
stirred by the soft evening breeze. With songs of
high thanksgiving the men of Delphi drew near to
the temple, and saw that Phœbus had placed again
within his shrine the sacred arms which no mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
man may handle. Then was there rich spoil gathered,
and the holy place of Apollo shone with gifts
of gold and silver, which the men of Delphi offered
in gladness of heart for all the great things which
he had done for them. And in every house of the
Delphians were seen robes and turbans rich with
gold and silver and embroidery. On their walls
hung spears and shields and swords and daggers
which the Persians bore when they came to Delphi.</p>

<p>In after days they told their children the wondrous
tale how Phœbus Apollo smote down the
hosts of Xerxes; and they showed them the spoils
which they took by the aid of the bright heroes, and
the two rocks, lying on the holy ground before his
shrine, which Phœbus tore from the peaks of Parnassus
in the day of his great vengeance.</p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_ARION">THE STORY OF ARION</h2>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">A long time ago, in the great city of Corinth,
there lived a man whose name was Arion, and
he made beautiful music on a golden harp, which
all the people flocked to listen to. Men and women,
boys and girls, all came to hear Arion play and
sing; and when his songs were ended they gave
him money, and Arion became a rich man. When
he had lived for a long time in the house of Periandros,
who was called the tyrant of Corinth, he
thought that he would like to see some new places
which he had never seen before. So he went into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a ship and asked the sailors to take him to Sicily
and Italy. They sailed over the blue sea a long
way for many days and weeks, and came to many
towns, where Arion played and sang and got more
money, till at last he came to Taras. There he
stayed a long time, because it was a rich and beautiful
city, and all the people who came to hear him
gave him plenty of money.</p>

<p>By and by Arion thought that he had enough
and he began to wish to see Corinth and his friend
Periandros once more. He went down to the beach
and said that he wanted a ship to take him back to
Corinth, and that he would only go with Corinthians,
because he thought the men of Corinth better
than the men of any other place. Just then there
was drawn up on the beach a ship which had come
from Corinth, and the sailors told him that they
were Corinthians, and would take him home again.
So Arion promised to go with them, and he sent
down his harp and all his boxes full of fine clothes
and gold and silver, to be put on board the ship.
When the sailors saw the boxes, and felt how heavy
they were, they said to each other, “What a rich
man he must be! would it not be pleasant to have
only a little of all this money which has been given
to Arion for playing on a harp?”</p>

<p>The next day Arion came down to the shore and
went into the ship. It was a beautiful day; there
was scarcely a cloud in the sky, and there was a
fresh breeze just strong enough to fill the sails and
move the ship gently through the water. The
waves danced and shone like gold in the bright sunshine,
while the ship tossed up the white foam as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
she sailed merrily on towards Corinth. So they
went on many days, for Arion sat at the head of
the ship to see how it cut through the water, and as
they passed one place after another, he thought that
they would soon reach Corinth. But the sailors in
the ship were wicked men. They had seen the large
boxes full of money which Arion had brought with
him into the ship, and now they made up their mind
to kill him and take his gold and silver. So one
day while he was sitting at the bow of the ship, and
looking down on the dark blue sea, three or four of
the sailors came up to him and said that they were
going to kill him. Now Arion knew that they said
this because they wanted his money; so he promised
to give them all that he had if they would spare his
life. But they would not. Then he asked them to
let him play once more on his harp, and sing one of
the songs which he loved the best, and he said that
when it was finished he would leap into the sea.
When they had given him leave to do this, Arion
put on a beautiful dress, took his harp in his hand,
and stood up to sing. And as he sang, the sailors
began to feel sorry that they were going to kill him,
because they would have no more of his sweet music
when he was dead. But when they thought of all
the gold and silver which Arion was taking to
Corinth, they made up their minds that they would
not let him live; and Arion took one last look at the
bright and sunny sky, and then leaped into the sea,
and the sailors saw him no more.</p>

<p>The ship sailed on merrily over the dark water,
just as though it were not carrying so many wicked
men to Corinth. But Arion was not drowned. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
great fish called a dolphin was swimming by the
ship when Arion leaped over; and it caught him on
its back and swam away with him towards Corinth
much faster than the ship could sail. On and on
the great fish swam, cutting through the foam of
the sea which was tossed up over Arion; and by
and by he saw at a distance the high cliffs and
peaks which he knew were the cliffs and peaks
above Corinth. So presently the fish came close to
the shore and left Arion on the beach, and swam
away again into the deep sea.</p>

<p>Arion was cold and tired with being so long in
the water, and he could hardly crawl up into the
city as far as the house where Periandros the tyrant
lived. At last he reached the house, and was taken
into the great hall where Periandros was sitting.
And when he saw Arion, Periandros rose up,
and came to meet him, and said: “Why, Arion,
what is all this? Your clothes are dripping with
water; I thought you were coming to Corinth from
Sicily in a ship, but you look more as if you had
been in the sea than in a ship: did you swim here
through the water?” Then Arion told him all the
story; how he had left Taras in a ship with Corinthian
men whom he had hired to bring him home,
how they had tried to kill him that they might take
his money, and how the dolphin had brought him to
the shore when they made him leap from the ship
into the sea. But Periandros did not believe the
story, and said to Arion, “You cannot make me
think that this strange tale is true: who ever swam
on a dolphin’s back before?” So he told his servants
to give Arion all that he wanted, but not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
let him go until the ship in which he had left Taras
came to Corinth.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, Arion was standing by
the side of Periandros, and looking out over the
sea. Presently he saw the white sails of a ship
which was sailing into the harbor with a gentle
breeze from the west. As it came nearer and
nearer, Arion thought that it looked very like his
own ship, until at last he was able to see from the
colors on its prow that it was the very ship in
which he had been sailing. Then he said to Periandros,
“See, they are come at last, and now go and
send for these sailors, and see whether I have not
told you the truth.” So Periandros sent down fifty
soldiers with swords and spears and shields, to bring
up all the sailors from the ship.</p>

<p>The ship was sailing in merrily towards the
shore, and the soft west wind filled out its white
sails as it cut through the water. As they looked
on the beautiful land to which they were coming,
they thought of all the things which they should be
able to buy with Arion’s gold and silver; and how
they would do nothing but eat and drink and be
merry, as soon as they got out of the ship. So
when they came to the beach, they let down the
sails, lowered the masts, and threw out ropes from
the stern to fasten the ship to the shore. They
never thought that the fifty soldiers whose spears
and shields were shining gaily in the sunshine had
been sent on purpose to take them; and they could
not make out why it was that, as soon as they came
out from the ship upon the dry land, the soldiers
said that they must all go as quickly as they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to the house of Periandros. Ten of the soldiers
stayed behind to guard the ship, while the rest led
the sailors to the palace. When they were brought
before him, Periandros spoke to them kindly, and
asked them from what place they had come; and
the sailors said that they had come from Italy, from
the great city of Taras. Then Periandros said, “If
you have come from Italy, perhaps you can tell me
something about my friend Arion. A long time
ago he left Corinth, and said that he was going to
Sicily and Italy; and I cannot think why he should
be away so long, for if the people have given him
as much money for his music as they did here, he
must now be a very rich man.” Then the sailors
said, “Yes, we can tell you all about Arion. We
left him quite safe at Taras, where every one
wanted to hear him sing; but he said that he should
not come to Corinth, until they had given him
more gold and silver and made him a richer man.”
Just as they were telling this lie, the door of the
room was opened, and Arion himself walked in;
and Periandros turned round to the sailors, and
said, “See, here is the man whom you left quite safe
and well at Taras. How dare you tell me so great
a lie? Now I know that Arion has told me the truth,
and that you wished to kill him, and made him leap
into the sea; but the dolphin caught him as he fell,
and brought him here on its back. And now listen
to me. Of all Arion’s gold and silver you shall have
none; everything that was his you shall give back
to him; and I shall take away your ship, and everything
in it which belongs to you, because you wished
to rob and kill Arion.” Then the soldiers came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and turned these wicked sailors into the street, and
drove them on, calling to the people to come and
see the men who had sought to murder Arion. And
all came out of their houses, and hooted at the
sailors as they passed by, until they were ready to
sink down with fear and shame.</p>

<p>So Periandros took their ship, and gave back to
Arion all his gold and silver, and what he loved
better than his riches—his golden harp. And every
one came to hear the wonderful tale of Arion and
the dolphin; and Arion made a large statue out of
stone to look like a man on a dolphin’s back, and
placed it on Cape Tainaron, that the people might
never forget how the dolphin saved Arion when he
leaped into the sea.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BATTLE_OF_THE_FROGS_AND">THE BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND
THE MICE</h2>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">A thirsty mouse, who had just escaped
from a weasel, was drinking from a pool of
water, when a croaking frog saw him, and said,
“Stranger, when hast thou come to our shore, and
who is thy father? Tell me the truth, and deceive
me not, for if thou deservest it, I will lead thee to
my house and give thee rich and beautiful gifts.
My name is Puffcheek, and I rule over the frogs
who dwell in this lake, and I see that thou, too, art
an excellent prince and a brave warrior. So make
haste, and tell me to what race thou dost belong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The mouse answered him and said, “Friend, why
dost thou ask me of my race? It is known to all
the gods, and to men, and to all the birds of heaven.
My name is Crumbfilcher and I am the son of the
great-hearted Breadgnawer, and my mother is
Lickmill, the daughter of King Hamnibbler. I
was born in a hovel, and fed on figs and nuts and
on all manner of good things. But how can we be
friends? We are not at all like each other. You
frogs live in the water; we feed on whatever is
eaten by man. No dainty escapes my eye, whether
it be bread, or cake, or ham, or new-made cheese,
or rich dishes prepared for feasts. As to war, I
have never dreaded its noise, but, going straight
into it, have taken my place among the foremost
warriors. Nor do I fear men, although they have
large bodies; for at night I can bite a finger or nibble
a heel without waking the sleeper from his
pleasant slumber. But there are two things which I
dread greatly—a mouse-trap and a hawk; but
worse than these are the weasels, for they can catch
us in our holes. What then am I to do? for I cannot
eat the cabbages, radishes, and pumpkins,
which furnish food to the race of frogs.”</p>

<p>Then Puffcheek answered with a smile, “My
friend, thou art dainty enough, but we have fine
things to show on the dry land and in the marsh,
for the son of Cronos has given us the power to
dwell on land or in the water as it may please us.
If thou wouldst see these things, it is soon done.
Get on my back and hold on well, so that thou
mayest reach my house with a cheerful heart.” So
he turned his bade to the mouse, who sprang lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
on it and put his arms round his soft neck. Much
pleased he was at first to swim on the back of Puffcheek,
while the haven was near; but when he got
out into midwater, he began to weep and to curse
his useless sorrow. He tore his hair, and drew his
feet tightly round the frog’s stomach. His heart
beat wildly, and he wished himself well on shore, as
he uttered a pitiful cry and spread out his tail on
the water, moving it about like an oar. Then in
the bitterness of his grief he said, “Surely it was
not thus the bull carried the beautiful Europa on
his back over the sea to Crete; surely—” But
before he could say more, a snake, of which frogs
and mice alike are afraid, lifted up his head straight
above the water. Down dived Puffcheek, when
he saw the snake, never thinking that he had left
the mouse to die. The frog was safe at the bottom
of the marsh, but the mouse fell on his back and
screamed terribly. Many times he sank and many
times he came up again, kicking hard; but there
was no hope. The hair on his skin was soaked
and weighed him down, and with his last breath
he cried, “Puffcheek, thou shalt not escape for thy
treachery. On the land I could have beaten thee
in boxing, wrestling, or running; but thou hast
beguiled me into the water, where I can do nothing.
The eye of justice sees thee, and thou shalt pay a
fearful penalty to the great army of the mice.”</p>

<p>So the Crumbfilcher died; but Lickplatter saw
him as he sat on the soft bank, and uttering a sharp
cry, went to tell the mice. Then was there great
wrath among them, and messengers were sent to
bid all come in the morning to the house of Breadgnawer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the father of the luckless Crumbfilcher,
whose body could not even be buried, because it
was floating in the middle of the pond. They came
at dawn, and Breadgnawer, rising in grief and
rage, said, “Friends, I may be the only one whom
the frogs have sorely injured; but we all live a poor
life, and I am in sad plight, for I have lost three
sons. The first was slain by a hateful weasel who
caught him outside his hole. The next one cruel
men brought to his death by a newfangled device
of wood, which they call a trap; and now my darling
Crumbfilcher has been drowned. Come and
let us arm ourselves for war and go forth to battle.”</p>

<p>So they each put on his armor. For greaves
around their legs they used the beans on which
they fed at night, and their breastplates they made
cunningly out of the skin of a dead weasel. For
spears they carried skewers, and the shell of a nut
for a helmet. So they stood in battle array, and
the frogs, when they came to hear of it, rose from
the water and summoned a council in a corner of
the pond. As they wondered what might be the
cause of these things, there came a messenger from
the mice, who declared war against them and said,
“Ye frogs, the mice bid you arm yourselves and
come forth to battle, for they have seen Crumbfilcher,
whom your king Puffcheek drowned, floating
dead on the water.” Then the valiant frogs
feared exceedingly, and blamed the deed of Puffcheek;
but the king said, “Friends, I did not kill
the mouse or see him die; of course he was drowned
while he amused himself in the pond by trying to
swim like a frog, and the wretches now bring a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
charge against me who am wholly guiltless. But
come, let us take counsel how we may destroy these
mice and this, I think, is the best plan. Let us arm
ourselves and take our stand where the bank is
steepest, and when they come charging against us,
let us seize their helmets and drag them down into
the pond. Thus we shall drown them all and set
up a trophy for our victory.” So they each put on
his armor. They covered their legs with mallow
leaves, and carried radish leaves for shields, rushes
for spears, snail-shells for helmets. Thus they
stood in array on the high bank, brandishing their
spears and shouting for battle.</p>

<p>But Jupiter summoned the gods to the starry
heaven, and, pointing to the hosts of the frogs and
mice, mighty as the armies of the Centaurs or the
giants, he asked who would aid each side as it might
be hard pressed in the strife; and he said to Minerva,
“Daughter, thou wilt go surely to the aid of
the mice, for they are always running about thy
shrine, and delight in the fat and the morsels which
they pick from the sacrifices.”</p>

<p>But Minerva said to the son of Cronos, “Father,
I go not to help the mice, for they have done me
grievous mischief, spoiling the garlands and the
lamps for the sake of the oil. Nay, I have greater
cause for anger, for they have eaten the robe which
I wove from fine thread, and made holes in it; and
the man who mended it charges a high price, and,
worse still, I borrowed the stuff of which I wove it,
and now I cannot pay it back. Yet neither will I
aid the frogs, for they are not in their right senses.
A little while ago, I came back tired from war and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
wanting sleep; but they never let me close my eyes
with their clatter, and I lay sleepless with a headache
till the cock crew in the morning. But, O ye
gods, let us aid neither side, lest we be wounded
with their swords or spears, for they are sharp and
strong, even against gods; let us take our sport by
watching the strife in safety.”</p>

<p>The gods did as Minerva bade them, and went all
to one place. The gnats, with their great trumpets,
gave the signal for battle, and Jupiter thundered
out of the sky because of the woes that were coming.
Mighty were the deeds that were done on
both sides, and the earth and the pond were reddened
with the blood of the slain. As the fight went
on, Crumbstealer slew Garliceater before he came
to land; and Mudwalker, seeing it, threw at him a
clod of earth, and, hitting him on the forehead,
almost blinded him. In his fury, Crumbstealer
seized a great stone, and crushed the leg of the
frog, so that he fell on his back in the dust. Then
Breadgnawer wounded Puffcheek in the foot, and
made him limp into the water.</p>

<p>But among the mice was a young hero, with
whom none could be matched for boldness and
strength, and his name was Bitstealer. On the
bank of the pond he stood alone, and vowed a vow
to destroy the whole race of frogs. And the vow
would have been accomplished, for his might was
great indeed, had not the son of Cronos pitied the
frogs in their misery, and charged Minerva and
Mars to drive Bitstealer from the battle. But Mars
made answer and said, “O Jupiter, neither Minerva
nor Mars alone can save the frogs from death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Let us all go and help them; and do thou, son of
Cronos, wield thy mighty weapon with which thou
didst slay the Titans, and the wild race of giants,
for thus only can the bravest of them be slain.” So
spake Mars; and Jupiter hurled his scathing thunderbolts,
and the lightnings flashed from the sky,
and Olympus shook with the earthquake. The frogs
and mice heard and trembled; but the mice ceased
not yet from the battle, and strove only the more
to slay their enemies, until Jupiter, in his pity, sent
a new army to aid the frogs.</p>

<p>Suddenly they came on the mice, with mailed
backs and crooked claws, with limping gait, and
mouths like shears. Their backs were hard and
horny, their arms were long and lean, and their
eyes were in their breasts. They had eight feet
and two heads, and no hands. Men call them
crabs. With their mouths they bit the tails and
feet and hands of the mice, and broke their spears,
and great terror came on all the mice, so that they
turned and fled. Thus the battle was ended, and
the sun went down.</p>

<h2 id="ORPHEUS_THE_SWEET_SINGER">ORPHEUS THE SWEET SINGER</h2>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the pleasant valleys of a country which was
called Thessaly, there lived a man whose name
was Orpheus. Every day he made soft music with
his golden harp, and sang beautiful songs such as
no one had ever heard before. And whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Orpheus sang, then everything came to listen to
him, and the trees bowed down their heads to hear;
even the clouds sailed along more gently and
brightly in the sky when he sang, and the stream
which ran close to his feet made a softer noise, to
show how glad his music made it.</p>

<p>Now Orpheus had a wife who was called Eurydice,
whom he loved very dearly. All through the
winter when the snow was on the hills, and all
through the summer when the sunshine made everything
beautiful, Orpheus used to sing to her; and
Eurydice sat on the grass by his side while the
beasts came round to listen, and the trees bowed
down their heads to hear him.</p>

<p>But one day when Eurydice was playing with
some children on the banks of the river, she trod
upon a snake in the long grass, and the snake bit
her. And by and by she began to be very sick,
and Eurydice knew that she must die. So she told
the children to go to Orpheus (for he was far
away) and say how sorry she was to leave him,
and that she loved him always very dearly; and
then she put her head down upon the soft grass,
and fell asleep and died. Sad indeed was Orpheus
when the children came to tell him that Eurydice
was dead. He felt so wretched that he never played
upon his golden harp, and he never opened his
lips to sing; and the beasts that used to listen to
him wondered why Orpheus sat all alone on the
green bank where Eurydice used to sit with him,
and why it was that he never made any more beautiful
music. All day long he sat there, and his
cheeks were often wet with tears. At last he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
“I cannot stay here any more; I must go and look
for Eurydice. I cannot bear to be without her, and
perhaps the king of the land where people go after
they are dead will let her come back and live with
me again.”</p>

<p>So he took his harp in his hand, and went to
look for Eurydice in the land where the sun goes
down into his golden cup before the night comes
on. He went on and on a very long way, till at
last he came to a high and dark gateway. It was
barred across with iron bars, and was bolted and
locked so that nobody could open it. It was a
wretched and gloomy place, because the sunshine
never came there, and it was covered with clouds
and mist. In front of this great gateway there
sat a monstrous dog, with three heads, six eyes,
and three tongues; and everything was dark
around, except his eyes, which shone like fire, and
which saw every one that dared to come near. Now
when Orpheus came looking for Eurydice, the dog
raised his three heads, opened his three mouths, and
gnashed his teeth at him, and roared terribly; but
when Orpheus came nearer, the dog jumped up on
his feet ready to fly at him and tear him to pieces.
Then Orpheus took down his harp and began to
play upon its golden strings. And the dog Cerberus
(for that was his name) growled and snarled
and showed the great white teeth in his three
mouths; but he could not help hearing the sweet
music, and he wondered why it was that he no
longer wished to tear Orpheus in pieces. Soon the
music made him quiet and still, and at last it lulled
him to sleep. Then Orpheus passed by him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
came up to the gate, and found it wide open, for it
had come open of its own accord while he was singing.
He was glad when he saw this, for he thought
that now he should see Eurydice.</p>

<p>So he went on and on a long way, until he came
to the palace of the king; and there were guards
placed before the door who tried to keep him from
going in; but Orpheus played upon his harp, and
they could not help letting him pass.</p>

<p>So he went into the great hall, where he saw the
king and queen sitting on a throne; and as he came
near, the king called out to him with a loud and
terrible voice, “Who are you, and how dare you to
come here? Do you not know that no one is
allowed to come here till after he is dead? I will
have you chained and placed in a dungeon, from
which you will never be able to get out.” Orpheus
said nothing; but took his golden harp in his hand
and began to sing more sweetly and gently than
ever. And as he sang, the face of the king began
to look almost glad, and his anger passed away.
Then the king said, “You have made me feel happy
with your sweet music, although I have never felt
happy before; and now tell me why you have come,
because you must want something, for, otherwise,
no one would come, before he was dead, to this sad
and gloomy land of which I am the king.” Then
Orpheus said, “O king, give me back my dear
Eurydice, and let her go from this gloomy place
and live with me on the bright earth again.” So
the king said that she could go. And the king said
to Orpheus, “I have given you what you wanted,
because you sang so sweetly; and when you go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
back to the earth from this place, your wife whom
you love shall go up after you: but remember that
you must never look back until she has reached the
earth, for if you do, Eurydice will be brought back
here, and I shall not be able to give her to you
again, even if you should sing more sweetly and
gently than ever.”</p>

<p>Now Orpheus was longing to see Eurydice, and
he hoped that the king would let him see her at
once; but when the king said that he must not try
to see her till she had reached the earth, he was quite
content, for he said, “Shall I not wait patiently a
little while, that Eurydice may come and live with
me again?” So he promised the king that he would
go up to the earth without stopping to look behind
and see whether Eurydice was coming after him.</p>

<p>Then Orpheus left the palace of the king, and
he passed through the dark gateway, and the dog
Cerberus did not bark or growl, for he knew that
Orpheus would not have been allowed to come back,
if the king had not wished it. So he went on and
on a long way; and he became impatient, and
longed more and more to see Eurydice. At last he
came near to the land of living men, and he saw
just a little streak of light, where the sun was
going to rise from the sea; and presently the sky
became brighter, and he saw everything before him
so clearly that he could not help turning round to
look at Eurydice. But, ah! she had not yet quite
reached the earth, and so he lost her again. He
saw something pale and white, which looked like
his own dear wife; and he just heard a soft and
gentle voice, which sounded like the voice of Eurydice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and then it all melted away. And still he
thought that he saw that pale white face, and heard
that soft voice, which said, “O Orpheus, Orpheus,
why did you look back? How dearly I love you,
and how glad I should have been to live with you
again; but now I must go back, because you have
broken your promise to the king, and I must not
even kiss you, and say how much I love you.”</p>

<p>Orpheus sat down at the place where Eurydice
was taken from him; he could go no further. There
he stayed day after day, and his cheeks became
paler, and his body weaker and weaker, till at
last he knew that he must die. And Orpheus was
not sorry; for although he loved the bright earth,
with all its flowers and grass and sunny streams, he
knew that he could not be with Eurydice again until
he had left it. So at last he laid his head upon
the earth, and fell asleep, and died: and then he and
Eurydice saw each other in the land which is far
away, where the sun goes down at night into his
golden cup, and were never parted again.</p>

<h2 id="NIOBE_A_VICTIM_OF_LATONAS">NIOBE, A VICTIM OF LATONA’S
JEALOUSY</h2>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="dropcap">Niobe, the Queen of Thebes, had much to be
proud of; but it was not her husband’s fame,
nor her own beauty, nor their great descent, nor
the power of their kingdom that elated her. It was
her children; and truly the happiest of mothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
would Niobe have been if only she had not claimed
to be so.</p>

<p>It was on occasion of the annual celebration in
honor of Latona and her offspring, Apollo and
Diana—when the people of Thebes were assembled,
their brows crowned with laurel, bearing frankincense
in the altars and paying their vows—that
Niobe appeared among the crowd. Her attire was
splendid with gold and gems, and her aspect beautiful
as the face of an angry woman can be. She
stood and surveyed the people with haughty looks.
“What folly,” said she, “is this!—to prefer beings
whom you never saw to those who stand before
your eyes! Why should Latona be honored with
worship, and none be paid to me? My father was
Tantalus, who was received as a guest at the table
of the gods; my mother was a goddess. My husband
built and rules this city, Thebes, and Phrygia
is my paternal inheritance. Wherever I turn my
eyes I survey the elements of my power; nor is my
form and presence unworthy of a goddess. To all
this let me add I have seven sons and seven daughters,
and look for sons-in-law and daughters-in-law
of pretensions worthy of my alliance. Have I
not cause for pride? Will you prefer to me this
Latona, the Titan’s daughter, with her two children?
I have seven times as many. Fortunate indeed
am I, and fortunate I shall remain! Will
any one deny this? My abundance is my security.
I feel myself too strong for Fortune to subdue.
She may take from me much; I shall still have
much left. Were I to lose some of my children, I
should hardly be left as poor as Latona with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
two only. Away with you from these solemnities—put
off the laurel from your brows—have done
with this worship!” The people obeyed, and left
the sacred services uncompleted.</p>

<p>The goddess was indignant. On the Cynthian
mountain top where she dwelt she thus addressed
her son and daughter: “My children, I who have
been so proud of you both, and have been used to
hold myself second to none of the goddesses except
Juno alone, begin now to doubt whether I am indeed
a goddess. I shall be deprived of my worship
altogether unless you protect me.”</p>

<p>She was proceeding in this strain, but Apollo interrupted
her. “Say no more,” said he; “speech
only delays punishment.”</p>

<p>So said Diana also. Darting through the air,
veiled in clouds, they alighted on the towers of the
city. Spread out before the gates was a broad
plain, where the youth of the city pursued their
warlike sports. The sons of Niobe were there with
the rest—some mounted on spirited horses richly
caparisoned, some driving gay chariots.</p>

<p>Ismenos, the first-born, as he guided his foaming
steeds, struck with an arrow from above, cried out,
“Ah, me!” dropped the reins, and fell lifeless. Another,
hearing the sound of the bow—like a boatman
who sees the storm gathering and makes all
sail for the port—gave the reins to his horses and
attempted to escape. The arrow overtook him as
he fled. Two younger boys, just from their tasks,
had gone to the playground to have a game of
wrestling. As they stood breast to breast, one arrow
pierced them both. They uttered a cry together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
cast a parting look around them, and together
breathed their last. Alphenor, an elder
brother, seeing them fall, hastened to the spot to
render assistance, and fell stricken in the act.</p>

<p>One only was left, Ilioneus. He raised his arms
to heaven to try whether prayer might not vail.
“Spare me, ye gods!” he cried, addressing all; and
Apollo would have spared him, but the arrow had
already left the string, and it was too late.</p>

<p>The terror of the people and grief of the attendants
soon made Niobe acquainted with what had
taken place. She could hardly think it possible;
she was indignant that the gods had dared, and
amazed that they had been able, to do it. Her husband,
Amphion, overwhelmed with the blow, destroyed
himself.</p>

<p>Alas! how different was this Niobe from her who
had so lately driven away the people from the
sacred rites, and held her stately course through
the city, the envy of her friends, now the pity even
of her foes! She knelt over the lifeless bodies, and
kissed now one, now another of her dead sons.
Raising her pallid arms to heaven, “Cruel Latona,”
said she, “feed full your rage with my anguish!
Satiate your hard heart, while I follow to the grave
my seven sons. Yet where is your triumph? Bereaved
as I am, I am still richer than you, my conqueror.”</p>

<p>Scarce had she spoken, when the bow sounded
and struck terror into all hearts except Niobe’s
alone. She was brave from excess of grief. The
sisters stood in garments of mourning over the biers
of their dead brothers. One fell, struck by an arrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and died on the corpse she was bewailing. Another,
attempting to console her mother, suddenly
ceased to speak, and sank lifeless to the earth. A
third tried to escape by flight, a fourth by concealment,
another stood trembling, uncertain what
course to take. Six were now dead, and only one
remained, whom the mother held clasped in her
arms, and covered as it were with her whole body.
“Spare me one, and that the youngest! O spare
me one of so many!” she cried; and while she spoke,
that one fell dead. Desolate she sat, among sons,
daughters, husband, all dead, stunned with grief.
The breeze moved not her hair, no color was on her
cheek, her eyes glared fixed and immovable, there
was no sign of life about her. Her very tongue
cleaved to the roof of her mouth. She was changed
to stone. Yet tears continued to flow; and borne
on a whirlwind to her native mountain, she still remains,
a mass of rock, from which a trickling stream
flows, the tribute of her never-ending grief.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SAD_STORY_OF_PYRAMUS_AND">THE SAD STORY OF PYRAMUS AND
THISBE</h2>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="dropcap">Pyramus was the handsomest youth, and
Thisbe the fairest maiden, in all Babylon,
where Semiramis reigned. Their parents occupied
adjoining houses, and acquaintance ripened into
love. They would gladly have married, but their
parents forbade. One thing, however, they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
not forbid—that love should glow with equal ardor
in the hearts of both. They conversed by signs
and glances, and the fire burned more intensely
for being covered up. In the wall that separated
the two houses there was a crack. No one had remarked
it before, but the lovers discovered it. It
afforded a passage to the voice, and messages used
to pass backward and forward through the gap.
“Cruel wall,” they said, “why do you keep us
apart? But we will not be ungrateful. We owe
you the privilege of transmitting loving words to
willing ears.” Such words they uttered on different
sides of the wall; and when night came and
they must say farewell, they pressed their lips upon
the wall, she on her side, he on his, as they could
come no nearer.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the sun had melted the
frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed
spot. Then, after lamenting their hard fate, they
agreed that next night, when all was still, they
would slip away from watchful eyes, leave their
dwellings and walk out into the fields; and to insure
a meeting, repair to a well-known edifice
standing without the city’s bounds, called the Tomb
of Ninus, and that the one who came first should
await the other at the foot of a certain tree. It
was a white mulberry tree, and stood near a cool
spring. All was agreed on, and they waited impatiently
for the sun to go down beneath the waters
and night to rise up from them. Then cautiously
Thisbe stole forth, unobserved by the family, her
head covered with a veil, made her way to the monument
and sat down under the tree. As she sat alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in the dim light of the evening she descried a lioness,
her jaws stained with recent slaughter, approaching
the fountain to slake her thirst. Thisbe fled at the
sight, and sought refuge in the hollow of a rock.
As she fled she dropped her veil. The lioness after
drinking at the spring turned to retreat to the
woods, and seeing the veil on the ground, tossed
and rent it with her bloody mouth.</p>

<p>Pyramus, having been delayed, now approached
the place of meeting. He saw in the sand the footsteps
of the lion, and the color fled from his cheeks
at the sight. Presently he found the veil all rent
and bloody. “O hapless girl,” said he, “I have been
the cause of thy death! Thou, more worthy of life
than I, hast fallen the first victim. I will follow.
I am the guilty cause, in tempting thee forth to a
place of such peril, and not being myself on the
spot to guard thee. Come forth, ye lions, from the
rocks, and tear this guilty body with your teeth.”
He took up the veil, carried it with him to the appointed
tree, and covered it with kisses and with
tears. “<em>My</em> blood also shall stain your texture,”
said he, and drawing his sword plunged it into his
heart. The blood spurted from the wound, and
tinged the white mulberries of the tree all red; and
sinking into the earth reached the roots, so that the
red color mounted through the trunk to the fruit.</p>

<p>By this time Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet
wishing not to disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously
forth, looking anxiously for the youth, eager
to tell him the danger she had escaped. When she
came to the spot and saw the changed color of the
mulberries she doubted whether it was the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
place. While she hesitated she saw the form of one
struggling in the agonies of death. She started
back, a shudder ran through her frame as a ripple
on the face of the still water when a sudden breeze
sweeps over it. But as soon as she recognized her
lover, she screamed, beat her breast, and embraced
the lifeless body. “O Pyramus,” she cried, “what
has done this? Answer me, Pyramus; it is Thisbe
that speaks. Hear me, dearest, and lift that drooping
head!” At the name of Thisbe Pyramus opened
his eyes, then closed them again. She saw her veil
stained with blood and the scabbard empty of its
sword. “Thy own hand has slain thee, and for my
sake,” she said. “I too can be brave for once, and
my love is as strong as thine. I will follow thee in
death, for I have been the cause; and death which
alone could part us shall not prevent my joining
thee. And ye, unhappy parents of us both, deny us
not our united request. As love and death have
joined us, let one tomb contain us. And thou, tree,
retain the marks of slaughter. Let thy berries still
serve for memorials of our blood.” So saying she
plunged the sword into her breast. Her parents
ratified her wish, the gods also ratified it. The two
bodies were buried in one sepulchre, and the tree
ever after brought forth purple berries, as it does
to this day.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TWELVE_LABORS_OF_HERCULES">THE TWELVE LABORS OF HERCULES</h2>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="dropcap">Hercules was the son of Jupiter and
Alcmena. As Juno was always hostile to the
offspring of her husband by mortal mothers, she
declared war against Hercules from his birth. She
sent two serpents to destroy him as he lay in his
cradle, but the brave infant strangled them with his
own hands.</p>

<p>He was, however, by the arts of Juno rendered
subject to Eurystheus and compelled to perform
all his commands. Eurystheus gave him a succession
of desperate tasks, which are called the
“Twelve Labors of Hercules,” The first was the
fight with the Nemean lion.</p>

<p>The valley of Nemea was infested by a terrible
lion. Eurystheus ordered Hercules to bring him
the skin of this monster. After using in vain his
club and arrows against the lion, Hercules strangled
the animal with his hands. He returned carrying
the dead lion on his shoulders; but Eurystheus was
so frightened at the sight of it and at this proof of
the prodigious strength of the hero, that he ordered
him to deliver the account of his exploits in future
outside the town.</p>

<p>His next labor was the slaughter of the Hydra.
This monster ravaged the country of Argos, and
dwelt in a swamp near the well of Amymone. This
well had been discovered by Amymone when the
country was suffering from drought, and the story
was that Neptune, who loved her, had permitted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to touch the rock with his trident, and a spring of
three outlets burst forth. Here the Hydra took up
his position, and Hercules was sent to destroy him.
The Hydra had nine heads, of which the middle one
was immortal.</p>

<p>Hercules struck off its heads with his club, but
in the place of the head knocked off, two new ones
grew forth each time. At length with the assistance
of his faithful servant Iolaus, he burned away
the heads of the Hydra, and buried the ninth or
immortal one under a huge rock.</p>

<p>Another labor was the cleaning of the Augean
stables. Augeas, King of Elis, had a herd of three
thousand oxen, whose stalls had not been cleansed
for thirty years. Hercules brought the rivers Alpheus
and Peneus through them, and cleansed them
thoroughly in one day.</p>

<p>His next labor was of a more delicate kind.
Admeta, the daughter of Eurystheus, longed to
obtain the girdle of the Queen of the Amazons, and
Eurystheus ordered Hercules to go and get it. The
Amazons were a nation of women. They were very
warlike and held several flourishing cities. It was
their custom to bring up only the female children;
the boys were either sent away to the neighboring
nations or put to death. Hercules was accompanied
by a number of volunteers, and after various adventures
at last reached the country of the Amazons.
Hippolyta, the queen, received him kindly,
and consented to yield him her girdle, but Juno,
taking the form of an Amazon, went and persuaded
the rest that the strangers were carrying off their
queen. They instantly armed and came in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
numbers down to the ship. Hercules, thinking that
Hippolyta had acted treacherously, slew her, and
taking her girdle made sail homeward.</p>

<p>Another task enjoined him was to bring to
Eurystheus the oxen of Geryon, a monster with
three bodies, who dwelt in the island Erytheia (the
red), so called because it lay at the west, under the
rays of the setting sun. This description is thought
to apply to Spain, of which Geryon was king. After
traversing various countries, Hercules reached at
length the frontiers of Libya and Europe, where
he raised the two mountains of Calpe and Abyla,
as monuments of his progress, or, according to
another account, rent one mountain into two and
left half on each side, forming the straits of Gibraltar,
the two mountains being called the Pillars of
Hercules. The oxen were guarded by the giant
Eurytion and his two-headed dog, but Hercules
killed the giant and his dog and brought away the
oxen in safety to Eurystheus.</p>

<p>The most difficult labor of all was getting the
golden apples of the Hesperides, for Hercules did
not know where to find them. These were the
apples which Juno had received at her wedding
from the goddess of the Earth, and which she had
intrusted to the keeping of the daughters of Hesperus,
assisted by a watchful dragon.</p>

<p>A celebrated exploit of Hercules was his victory
over Antæus. Antæus, the son of Terra, the
Earth, was a mighty giant and wrestler, whose
strength was invincible so long as he remained in
contact with his mother Earth. He compelled all
strangers who came to his country to wrestle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
him, on condition that if conquered (as they all
were) they should be put to death. Hercules encountered
him, and finding that it was of no avail
to throw him, for he always rose with renewed
strength from every fall, he lifted him up from the
earth and strangled him in the air.</p>

<p>Cacus was a huge giant, who inhabited a cave on
Mount Aventine, and plundered the surrounding
country. When Hercules was driving home the
oxen of Geryon, Cacus stole part of the cattle,
while the hero slept. That their footprints might
not serve to show where they had been driven, he
dragged them backward by their tails to his cave;
so their tracks all seemed to show that they had
gone in the opposite direction. Hercules was deceived
by this stratagem, and would have failed to
find his oxen, if it had not happened that in driving
the remainder of the herd past the cave where
the stolen ones were concealed, those within began
to low, and were thus discovered. Cacus was slain
by Hercules.</p>

<p>The last exploit we shall record was bringing
Cerberus from the lower world. Cerberus was the
three-headed dog that guarded the entrance to
Hades. Hercules descended into Hades, accompanied
by Mercury and Minerva. He obtained
permission from Pluto to carry Cerberus to the
upper air, provided he could do it without the use
of weapons; and in spite of the monster’s struggling,
he seized him, held him fast, and carried him
to Eurystheus, and afterward brought him back
again. When he was in Hades he obtained the
liberty of Theseus, his admirer and imitator, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had been detained a prisoner there for an unsuccessful
attempt to carry off Proserpine.</p>

<p>Hercules in a fit of madness killed his friend
Iphitus, and was condemned for this offence to become
the slave of Queen Omphale for three years.
While in this service the hero’s nature seemed
changed. He lived effeminately, wearing at times
the dress of a woman, spinning wool with the handmaidens
of Omphale, while the queen wore his
lion’s skin. When this service was ended he married
Dejanira and lived in peace with her three
years. On one occasion as he was travelling with
his wife, they came to a river, across which the Centaur
Nessus carried travellers for a stated fee.
Hercules himself forded the river, but gave Dejanira
to Nessus to be carried across. Nessus attempted
to run away with her, but Hercules heard
her cries and shot an arrow into the heart of Nessus.
The dying Centaur told Dejanira to take a portion
of his blood and keep it, as it might be used as
a charm to preserve the love of her husband.</p>

<p>Dejanira did so and before long fancied she had
occasion to use it. Hercules in one of his conquests
had taken prisoner a fair maiden, named Iole, of
whom he seemed more fond than Dejanira approved.
When Hercules was about to offer sacrifices
to the gods in honor of his victory, he sent
to his wife for a white robe to use on the occasion.
Dejanira, thinking it a good opportunity to try her
love-spell, steeped the garment in the blood of
Nessus. As soon as the garment became warm on
the body of Hercules the poison penetrated into
all his limbs and caused him the most intense agony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
In his frenzy he seized Lichas, who had brought
him the fatal robe, and hurled him into the sea.
He wrenched off the garment, but it stuck to his
flesh, and with it he tore away whole pieces of his
body. In this state he embarked on board a ship
and was conveyed home. Dejanira, on seeing what
she had unwittingly done, hung herself. Hercules,
prepared to die, ascended Mount Œta, where he
built a funeral pile of trees, gave his bow and arrows
to Philoctetes, and laid himself down on the
pile, his head resting on his club, and his lion’s skin
spread over him. With a countenance as serene as
if he were taking his place at a festal board he commanded
Philoctetes to apply the torch. The flames
spread apace and soon invested the whole mass.</p>

<p>The gods themselves felt troubled at seeing the
champion of the earth so brought to his end. But
Jupiter with cheerful countenance thus addressed
them: “Fear not. He who conquered all else is
not to be conquered by those flames which you see
blazing on Mount Œta. Only his mother’s share
in him can perish; what he derived from me is immortal.
I shall take him, dead to earth, to the
heavenly shores, and I require of you all to receive
him kindly.” Jupiter enveloped him in a cloud,
and took him up in a four-horse chariot to dwell
among the stars.</p>

<h2 id="HERCULESS_SEARCH_FOR_THE">HERCULES’S SEARCH FOR THE
APPLES OF HESPERIDES</h2>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">Did you ever hear of the golden apples that
grew in the garden of the Hesperides?
Ah, those were such apples as would bring a great
price, by the bushel, if any of them could be found
growing in the orchards of nowadays! But there
is not, I suppose, a graft of that wonderful fruit
on a single tree in the wide world. Not so much
as a seed of those apples exists any longer.</p>

<p>And, even in the old, old half-forgotten times,
before the garden of the Hesperides was overrun
with weeds, a great many people doubted whether
they could be real trees that bore apples of solid
gold upon their branches. All had heard of them,
but nobody remembered to have seen any. Children,
nevertheless, used to listen, open-mouthed, to
stories of the golden apple-tree, and resolved to
discover it, when they should be big enough.
Adventurous young men, who desired to do a
braver thing than any of their fellows, set out in
quest of this fruit. Many of them returned no
more; none of them brought back the apples. No
wonder that they found it impossible to gather
them! It is said that there was a dragon beneath
the tree, with a hundred terrible heads, fifty of
which were always on the watch, while the other
fifty slept.</p>

<p>In my opinion it was hardly worth running so
much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Had the apples been sweet, mellow, and juicy,
indeed that would be another matter. There
might then have been some sense in trying to get
at them, in spite of the hundred-headed dragon.</p>

<p>But, as I have already told you, it was quite a
common thing with young persons, when tired of
too much peace and rest, to go in search of the
garden of the Hesperides. And once the adventure
was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed
very little peace or rest since he came into the
world. At the time of which I am going to speak,
he was wandering through the pleasant land of
Italy, with a mighty club in his hand, and a bow
and quiver slung across his shoulders. He was
wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion
that ever had been seen, and which he himself had
killed; and though, on the whole, he was kind, and
generous, and noble, there was a good deal of the
lion’s fierceness in his heart. As he went on his
way, he continually inquired whether that were
the right road to the famous garden. But none
of the country people knew anything about the
matter, and many looked as if they would have
laughed at the question, if the stranger had not
carried so very big a club.</p>

<p>So he journeyed on and on, still making the same
inquiry, until, at last, he came to the brink of
a river where some beautiful young women sat
twining wreaths of flowers.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, pretty maidens,” asked the
stranger, “whether this is the right way to the
garden of the Hesperides?”</p>

<p>The young women had been having a fine time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
together, weaving the flowers into wreaths, and
crowning one another’s heads. And there seemed
to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers,
that made the flowers more fresh and dewy, and
of brighter hues, and sweeter fragrance, while they
played with them, than even when they had been
growing on their native stems. But, on hearing
the stranger’s question, they dropped all their
flowers on the grass, and gazed at him with
astonishment.</p>

<p>“The garden of the Hesperides!” cried one. “We
thought mortals had been weary of seeking it, after
so many disappointments. And pray, adventurous
traveller, what do you want there?”</p>

<p>“A certain king, who is my cousin,” replied he,
“has ordered me to get him three of the golden
apples.”</p>

<p>“Most of the young men who go in quest of
these apples,” observed another of the damsels,
“desire to obtain them for themselves, or to present
them to some fair maiden whom they love.
Do you, then, love this king, your cousin, so very
much?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied the stranger, sighing.
“He has often been severe and cruel to me. But
it is my destiny to obey him.”</p>

<p>“And do you know,” asked the damsel who had
first spoken, “that a terrible dragon, with a hundred
heads, keeps watch under the golden apple-tree?”</p>

<p>“I know it well,” answered the stranger, calmly.
“But from my cradle upwards, it has been my
business, and almost my pastime, to deal with
serpents and dragons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The young women looked at his massive club,
and at the shaggy lion’s skin which he wore, and
likewise at his heroic limbs and figure; and they
whispered to each other that the stranger appeared
to be one who might reasonably expect to perform
deeds far beyond the might of other men. But,
then, the dragon with a hundred heads! What
mortal, even if he possessed a hundred lives,
could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster?
So kind-hearted were the maidens, that they
could not bear to see this brave and handsome
traveller attempt what was so very dangerous,
and devote himself, most probably, to become a
meal for the dragon’s hundred ravenous mouths.</p>

<p>“Go back,” cried they all—“go back to your
own home! Your mother, beholding you safe and
sound, will shed tears of joy; and what can she
do more, should you win ever so great a victory?
No matter for the golden apples! No matter for
the king, your cruel cousin! We do not wish the
dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up!”</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to grow impatient at these
remonstrances. He carelessly lifted his mighty
club, and let it fall upon a rock that lay half
buried in the earth, near by. With the force of
that idle blow, the great rock was shattered all
to pieces. It cost the stranger no more effort to
achieve this feat of a giant’s strength than for one
of the young maidens to touch her sister’s rosy
cheek with a flower.</p>

<p>“Do you not believe,” said he, looking at the
damsels with a smile, “that such a blow would
have crushed one of the dragon’s hundred heads?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he sat down on the grass, and told them
the story of his life, or as much of it as he could
remember, from the day when he was first cradled
in a warrior’s brazen shield. While he lay there,
two immense serpents came gliding over the
floor, and opened their hideous jaws to devour
him; and he, a baby of a few months old, had
gripped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little
fists, and strangled them to death. When he was
but a stripling, he had killed a huge lion, almost
as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he
now wore upon his shoulders. The next thing
that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly
sort of monster, called a hydra, which had no less
than nine heads, and exceedingly sharp teeth in
every one.</p>

<p>“But the dragon of the Hesperides, you know,”
observed one of the damsels, “has a hundred
heads!”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” replied the stranger, “I would
rather fight two such dragons than a single hydra.
For, as fast as I cut off a head, two others grew
in its place; and, besides, there was one of the heads
that could not possibly be killed, but kept biting
as fiercely as ever, long after it was cut off. So I
was forced to bury it under a stone, where it is
doubtless alive to this very day. But the hydra’s
body, and its eight other heads, will never do any
further mischief.”</p>

<p>The damsels, judging that the story was likely
to last a good while, had been preparing a repast of
bread and grapes, that the stranger might refresh
himself in the intervals of his talk. They took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
pleasure in helping him to this simple food; and,
now and then, one of them would put a sweet
grape between her rosy lips, lest it should make
him bashful to eat alone.</p>

<p>The traveller proceeded to tell how he had
chased a very swift stag, for a twelvemonth
together, without ever stopping to take breath,
and had at last caught it by the antlers, and
carried it home alive. And he had fought with a
very odd race of people, half horses and half men,
and had put them all to death, from a sense of
duty in order that their ugly figures might never
be seen any more. Besides all this, he took to himself
great credit for having cleaned out a stable.</p>

<p>“Do you call that a wonderful exploit?” asked
one of the young maidens, with a smile. “Any
clown in the country has done as much!”</p>

<p>“Had it been an ordinary stable,” replied the
stranger, “I should not have mentioned it.
But this was so gigantic a task that it would
have taken me all my life to perform it, if I had
not luckily thought of turning the channel of a
river through the stable-door. That did the business
in a very short time!”</p>

<p>Seeing how earnestly his fair auditors listened,
he next told them how he had shot some monstrous
birds, and had caught a wild bull alive and let him
go again, and had tamed a number of very wild
horses, and had conquered Hippolyta, the warlike
Queen of the Amazons. He mentioned, likewise,
that he had taken off Hippolyta’s enchanted girdle,
and had given it to the daughter of his cousin, the
king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was it the girdle of Venus,” inquired the
prettiest of the damsels, “which makes women
beautiful?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the stranger. “It had formerly
been the sword-belt of Mars; and it can only make
the wearer valiant and courageous.”</p>

<p>“An old sword-belt!” cried the damsel, tossing
her head. “Then I should not care about having
it!”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>Going on with his wonderful narrative, he informed
the maidens that as strange an adventure
as ever happened was when he fought with Geryon,
the six-legged man. This was a very odd
and frightful sort of figure, as you may well believe.
Any person, looking at his tracks in the sand or
snow, would suppose that three sociable companions
had been walking along together. On hearing
his footsteps at a little distance, it was no more
than reasonable to judge that several people must
be coming. But it was only the strange man
Geryon clattering onward, with his six legs!</p>

<p>Six legs, and one gigantic body! Certainly, he
must have been a very queer monster to look at;
and, my stars, what a waste of shoe leather!</p>

<p>When the stranger had finished the story of his
adventures, he looked around at the attentive faces
of the maidens.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you may have heard of me before,” said
he, modestly. “My name is Hercules!”</p>

<p>“We had already guessed it,” replied the
maidens; “for your wonderful deeds are known all
over the world. We do not think it strange, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
longer, that you should set out in quest of the
golden apples of the Hesperides. Come, sisters,
let us crown the hero with flowers!”</p>

<p>Then they flung beautiful wreaths over his
stately head and mighty shoulders, so that the
lion’s skin was almost entirely covered with roses.
They took possession of his ponderous club, and so
entwined it about with the brightest, softest, and
most fragrant blossoms, that not a finger’s breadth
of its oaken substance could be seen. It looked all
like a huge bunch of flowers. Lastly, they joined
hands, and danced around him, chanting words
which became poetry of their own accord, and
grew into a choral song, in honor of the illustrious
Hercules.</p>

<p>And Hercules was rejoiced, as any other hero
would have been, to know that these fair young
girls had heard of the valiant deeds which it had
cost him so much toil and danger to achieve. But,
still, he was not satisfied. He could not think
that what he had already done was worthy of so
much honor, while there remained any bold or
difficult adventure to be undertaken.</p>

<p>“Dear maidens,” said he, when they paused to
take breath, “now that you know my name, will
you not tell me how I am to reach the garden of
the Hesperides?”</p>

<p>“Ah! must you go so soon?” they exclaimed.
“You—that have performed so many wonders,
and spent such a toilsome life—cannot you content
yourself to repose a little while on the margin
of this peaceful river?”</p>

<p>Hercules shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must depart now,” said he.</p>

<p>“We will then give you the best directions we
can,” replied the damsels. “You must go to the
seashore, and find out the Old One, and compel
him to inform you where the golden apples are to
be found.”</p>

<p>“The Old One!” repeated Hercules, laughing at
this odd name. “And, pray, who may the Old
One be?”</p>

<p>“Why, the Old Man of the Sea, to be sure!”
answered one of the damsels. “He has fifty
daughters, whom some people call very beautiful;
but we do not think it proper to be acquainted
with them, because they have sea-green hair, and
taper away like fishes. You must talk with this
Old Man of the Sea. He is a seafaring person,
and knows all about the garden of the Hesperides;
for it is situated in an island which he is often in
the habit of visiting.”</p>

<p>Hercules then asked whereabouts the Old One
was most likely to be met with. When the
damsels had informed him, he thanked them for
all their kindness—for the bread and grapes with
which they had fed him, the lovely flowers with
which they had crowned him, and the songs and
dances wherewith they had done him honor—and
he thanked them, most of all, for telling him the
right way—and immediately set forth upon his
journey.</p>

<p>But before he was out of hearing, one of the
maidens called after him.</p>

<p>“Keep fast hold of the Old One, when you
catch him!” cried she, smiling and lifting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
finger to make the caution more impressive. “Do
not be astonished at anything that may happen.
Only hold him fast, and he will tell you what you
wish to know.”</p>

<p>Hercules again thanked her, and pursued his
way, while the maidens resumed their pleasant
labor of making flower-wreaths. They talked about
the hero, long after he was gone.</p>

<p>“We will crown him with the loveliest of our
garlands,” said they, “when he returns hither with
the three golden apples, after slaying the dragon
with a hundred heads.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hercules travelled constantly onward,
over hill and dale, and through the solitary
woods. Sometimes he swung his club aloft, and
splintered a mighty oak with a downright blow.
His mind was so full of the giants and monsters
with whom it was the business of his life to fight,
that perhaps he mistook the great tree for a giant
or a monster. And so eager was Hercules to
achieve what he had undertaken, that he almost
regretted to have spent so much time with the
damsels, wasting idle breath upon the story of his
adventures.</p>

<p>But thus it always is with persons who are destined
to perform great things. What they have
already done seems less than nothing. What they
have taken in hand to do seems worth toil, danger,
and life itself.</p>

<p>Persons who happened to be passing through
the forest must have been affrighted to see him
smite the trees with his great club. With but
a single blow, the trunk was riven as by the stroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of lightning, and the broad boughs came rustling
and crashing down.</p>

<p>Hastening forward, without ever pausing or
looking behind, he by and by heard the sea
roaring at a distance. At this sound, he increased
his speed, and soon came to a beach, where the
great surf-waves tumbled themselves upon the hard
sand, in a long line of snowy foam. At one end
of the beach, however, there was a pleasant spot,
where some green shrubbery clambered up a cliff,
making its rocky face look soft and beautiful. A
carpet of verdant grass, largely intermixed with
sweet-smelling clover, covered the narrow space
between the bottom of the cliff and the sea. And
what should Hercules espy there, but an old man,
fast asleep!</p>

<p>But was it really and truly an old man? Certainly,
at first sight, it looked very like one;
but on closer inspection, it rather seemed to be some
kind of a creature that lived in the sea. For, on
his legs and arms there were scales, such as
fishes have; he was web-footed and web-fingered,
after the fashion of a duck; and his long beard,
being of a greenish tinge, had more the appearance
of a tuft of seaweed than of an ordinary beard.
Have you never seen a stick of timber, that has
been long tossed about by the waves, and has
got all overgrown with barnacles, and, at last
drifting ashore, seems to have been thrown up
from the very deepest bottom of the sea? Well,
the old man would have put you in mind of just
such a wave-tost spar! But Hercules, the instant
he set eyes on this strange figure, was convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
that it could be no other than the Old One, who
was to direct him on his way.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the selfsame Old Man of the Sea
whom the hospitable maidens had talked to him
about. Thanking his stars for the lucky accident
of finding the old fellow asleep, Hercules stole on
tiptoe towards him, and caught him by the arm
and leg.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” cried he, before the Old One was
well awake, “which is the way to the garden of the
Hesperides.”</p>

<p>As you may easily imagine, the Old Man of the
Sea awoke in a fright. But his astonishment
could hardly have been greater than was that of
Hercules, the next moment. For, all of a sudden,
the Old One seemed to disappear out of his grasp,
and he found himself holding a stag by the fore
and hind leg! But still he kept fast hold. Then
the stag disappeared, and in its stead there
was a sea-bird, fluttering and screaming, while
Hercules clutched it by the wing and claw! But
the bird could not get away. Immediately afterwards,
there was an ugly three-headed dog, which
growled and barked at Hercules, and snapped
fiercely at the hands by which he held him! But
Hercules would not let him go. In another
minute, instead of the three-headed dog, what
should appear but Geryon, the six-legged man-monster,
kicking at Hercules with five of
his legs, in order to get the remaining one at
liberty! But Hercules held on. By and by, no
Geryon was there, but a huge snake, like one of
those which Hercules had strangled in his babyhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
only a hundred times as big; and it twisted
and twined about the hero’s neck and body, and
threw its tail high into the air, and opened its
deadly jaws as if to devour him outright; so that
it was really a very terrible spectacle! But
Hercules was no whit disheartened, and squeezed
the great snake so tightly that he soon began to
hiss with pain.</p>

<p>You must understand that the Old Man of the
Sea, though he generally looked so much like the
wave-beaten figurehead of a vessel, had the power
of assuming any shape he pleased. When he
found himself so roughly seized by Hercules, he
had been in hopes of putting him into such surprise
and terror, by these magical transformations,
that the hero would be glad to let him go. If Hercules
had relaxed his grasp, the Old One would certainly
have plunged down to the very bottom of
the sea, whence he would not soon have given himself
the trouble of coming up, in order to answer
any impertinent questions. Ninety-nine people
out of a hundred, I suppose, would have been
frightened out of their wits by the very first of his
ugly shapes, and would have taken to their heels at
once. For one of the hardest things in this world
is to see the difference between real dangers and
imaginary ones.</p>

<p>But, as Hercules held on so stubbornly, and
only squeezed the Old One so much the tighter
at every change of shape, and really put him to
no small torture, he finally thought it best to
reappear in his own figure. So there he was
again, a fishy, scaly, web-footed sort of personage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
with something like a tuft of seaweed at his
chin.</p>

<p>“Pray, what do you want with me?” cried the
Old One as soon as he could take breath; for it is
quite a tiresome affair to go through so many false
shapes. “Why do you squeeze me so hard? Let
me go, this moment, or I shall begin to consider
you an extremely uncivil person!”</p>

<p>“My name is Hercules!” roared the mighty
stranger. “And you will never get out of my
clutch, until you tell me the nearest way to the
garden of the Hesperides!”</p>

<p>When the old fellow heard who it was that had
caught him, he saw, with half an eye, that it would
be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted
to know. The Old One was an inhabitant of the
sea, you must recollect, and roamed about everywhere,
like other seafaring people. Of course, he
had often heard of the fame of Hercules, and of the
wonderful things that he was constantly performing,
in various parts of the earth, and how determined
he always was to accomplish whatever he
undertook. He therefore made no more attempts
to escape, but told the hero how to find the garden
of the Hesperides, and likewise warned him of
many difficulties which must be overcome, before
he could arrive thither.</p>

<p>“You must go on, thus and thus,” said the Old
Man of the Sea, after taking the points of the compass,
“till you come in sight of a very tall giant,
who holds the sky on his shoulders. And the
giant, if he happens to be in the humor, will tell you
exactly where the garden of the Hesperides lies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“And if the giant happens not to be in the
humor,” remarked Hercules, balancing his club on
the tip of his finger, “perhaps I shall find means
to persuade him!”</p>

<p>Thanking the Old Man of the Sea, and begging
his pardon for having squeezed him so roughly, the
hero resumed his journey. He met with a great
many strange adventures, which would be well
worth your hearing, if I had leisure to narrate
them as minutely as they deserve.</p>

<p>It was in this journey, if I mistake not, that he
encountered a prodigious giant, who was so wonderfully
contrived by nature, that every time he
touched the earth, he became ten times as strong
as ever he had been before. His name was
Antæus. You may see, plainly enough, that it
was a very difficult business to fight with such a
fellow; for, as often as he got a knock-down blow,
up he started again, stronger, fiercer, and abler to
use his weapons than if his enemy had let him
alone. Thus, the harder Hercules pounded the
giant with his club, the further he seemed from
winning the victory. I have sometimes argued
with such people, but never fought with one. The
only way in which Hercules found it possible to
finish the battle was by lifting Antæus off his feet
into the air, and squeezing, and squeezing, and
squeezing him, until, finally, the strength was quite
squeezed out of his enormous body.</p>

<p>When this affair was finished, Hercules continued
his travels, and went to the land of Egypt,
where he was taken prisoner, and would have
been put to death, if he had not slain the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the country, and made his escape. Passing
through the deserts of Africa, and going as fast as
he could, he arrived at last on the shore of the
great ocean. And here, unless he could walk on
the crests of the billows, it seemed as if his journey
must needs be at an end.</p>

<p>Nothing was before him, save the foaming,
dashing, measureless ocean. But, suddenly, as
he looked towards the horizon, he saw something,
a great way off, which he had not seen the moment
before. It gleamed very brightly, almost as you
may have beheld the round, golden disk of the
sun, when it rises or sets over the edge of the world.
It evidently drew nearer; for, at every instant,
this wonderful object became larger and more
lustrous. At length, it had come so nigh that
Hercules discovered it to be an immense cup or
bowl, made either of gold or burnished brass.
How it had got afloat upon the sea is more than I
can tell you. There it was, at all events, rolling
on the tumultuous billows, which tossed it up and
down, and heaved their foamy tops against its sides,
but without ever throwing their spray over the
brim.</p>

<p>“I have seen many giants, in my time,” thought
Hercules, “but never one that would need to drink
his wine out of a cup like this!”</p>

<p>And, true enough, what a cup it must have
been! It was as large—as large—but, in short, I
am afraid to say how immeasurably large it was.
To speak within bounds, it was ten times larger
than a great mill-wheel; and, all of metal as it
was, it floated over the heaving surges more lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
than an acorn-cup adown the brook. The waves
tumbled it onward, until it grazed against the
shore, within a short distance of the spot where
Hercules was standing.</p>

<p>As soon as this happened, he knew what was to
be done; for he had not gone through so many
remarkable adventures without learning pretty
well how to conduct himself, whenever anything
came to pass a little out of the common rule. It
was just as clear as daylight that this marvellous
cup had been set adrift by some unseen power,
and guided hitherward, in order to carry Hercules
across the sea, on his way to the garden of the
Hesperides. Accordingly, without a moment’s
delay, he clambered over the brim, and slid down
on the inside, where, spreading out his lion’s skin,
he proceeded to take a little repose. He had
scarcely rested, until now, since he bade farewell
to the damsels on the margin of the river. The
waves dashed, with a pleasant and ringing sound,
against the circumference of the hollow cup; it
rocked lightly to and fro, and the motion was
so soothing that it speedily rocked Hercules into
an agreeable slumber.</p>

<p>His nap had probably lasted a good while, when
the cup chanced to graze against a rock, and, in
consequence, immediately resounded and reverberated
through its golden or brazen substance,
a hundred times as loudly as ever you heard a
church-bell. The noise awoke Hercules, who
instantly started up and gazed around him,
wondering whereabouts he was. He was not long
in discovering that the cup had floated across a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
great part of the sea, and was approaching the
shore of what seemed to be an island. And, on that
island, what do you think he saw?</p>

<p>No; you will never guess it, not if you were to
try fifty thousand times! It positively appears
to me that this was the most marvellous spectacle
that had ever been seen by Hercules, in the whole
course of his wonderful travels and adventures. It
was a greater marvel than the hydra with nine
heads, which kept growing twice as fast as they
were cut off; greater than the six-legged man-monster;
greater than Antæus; greater than anything
that was ever beheld by anybody, before or
since the days of Hercules, or than anything that
remains to be beheld, by travellers in all time to
come. It was a giant!</p>

<p>But such an intolerably big giant. A giant as
tall as a mountain; so vast a giant, that the clouds
rested about his midst, like a girdle, and hung like
a hoary beard from his chin, and flitted before his
huge eyes, so that he could neither see Hercules nor
the golden cup in which he was voyaging. And,
most wonderful of all, the giant held up his great
hands and appeared to support the sky, which, so
far as Hercules could discern through the clouds,
was resting upon his head! This does really seem
almost too much to believe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bright cup continued to float
onward, and finally touch the strand. Just then
a breeze wafted away the clouds from before the
giant’s visage, and Hercules beheld it, with all its
enormous features; eyes each of them as big as
yonder lake, a nose a mile long, and a mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of the same width. It was a countenance terrible
from its enormity of size, but disconsolate and
weary, even as you may see the faces of many
people, nowadays, who are compelled to sustain
burdens above their strength. What the sky
was to the giant, such are the cares of earth to
those who let themselves be weighed down by
them. And whenever men undertake what is
beyond the just measure of their abilities, they
encounter precisely such a doom as had befallen
this poor giant.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! He had evidently stood there a
long while. An ancient forest had been growing
and decaying around his feet; and oak-trees, of six
or seven centuries old, had sprung from the acorn,
and forced themselves between his toes.</p>

<p>The giant now looked down from the far height
of his great eyes, and, perceiving Hercules, roared
out, in a voice that resembled thunder, proceeding
out of the cloud that had just flitted away from
his face.</p>

<p>“Who are you, down at my feet there? And
whence do you come, in that little cup?”</p>

<p>“I am Hercules!” thundered back the hero, in
a voice pretty nearly or quite as loud as the giant’s
own. “And I am seeking for the garden of the
Hesperides!”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho!” roared the giant, in a fit of immense
laughter. “That is a wise adventure truly!”</p>

<p>“And why not?” cried Hercules, getting a little
angry at the giant’s mirth. “Do you think I am
afraid of the dragon with a hundred heads!”</p>

<p>Just at this time, while they were talking together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
some black clouds gathered about the
giant’s middle, and burst into a tremendous storm
of thunder and lightning, causing such a pother
that Hercules found it impossible to distinguish a
word. Only the giant’s immeasurable legs were
to be seen, standing up into the obscurity of
the tempest; and, now and then, a momentary
glimpse of his whole figure, mantled in a volume
of mist. He seemed to be speaking, most of the
time; but his big, deep, rough voice chimed in
with the reverberations of the thunder-claps, and
rolled away over the hills, like them. Thus, by
talking out of season, the foolish giant expended
an incalculable quantity of breath, to no purpose;
for the thunder spoke quite as intelligibly
as he.</p>

<p>At last, the storm swept over, as suddenly as
it had come. And there again was the clear sky,
and the weary giant holding it up, and the pleasant
sunshine beaming over his vast height, and illuminating
it against the background of the sullen
thunderclouds. So far above the shower had
been his head, that not a hair of it was moistened
by the rain-drops!</p>

<p>When the giant could see Hercules still standing
on the seashore, he roared out to him anew.</p>

<p>“I am Atlas, the mightiest giant in the world!
And I hold the sky upon my head!”</p>

<p>“So I see,” answered Hercules. “But, can you
show me the way to the garden of the Hesperides?”</p>

<p>“What do you want there?” asked the giant.</p>

<p>“I want three of the golden apples,” shouted
Hercules, “for my cousin, the king.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is nobody but myself,” quoth the giant,
“that can go to the garden of the Hesperides, and
gather the golden apples. If it were not for this
little business of holding up the sky, I would make
half a dozen steps across the sea, and get them for
you.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” replied Hercules. “And
cannot you rest the sky upon a mountain?”</p>

<p>“None of them are quite high enough,” said
Atlas, shaking his head. “But, if you were to take
your stand on the summit of that nearest one, your
head would be pretty nearly on a level with mine.
You seem to be a fellow of some strength. What
if you should take my burden on your shoulders,
while I do your errand for you?”</p>

<p>Hercules, as you must be careful to remember,
was a remarkably strong man; and though it certainly
requires a great deal of muscular power to
uphold the sky, yet, if any mortal could be supposed
capable of such an exploit, he was the one.
Nevertheless, it seemed so difficult an undertaking,
that, for the first time in his life, he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Is the sky very heavy?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, not particularly so, at first,” answered
the giant, shrugging his shoulders. “But it gets
to be a little burdensome, after a thousand years!”</p>

<p>“And how long a time,” asked the hero, “will
it take you to get the golden apples?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be done in a few moments,” cried
Atlas. “I shall take ten or fifteen miles at a stride,
and be at the garden and back again before your
shoulders begin to ache.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” answered Hercules, “I will climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the mountain behind you there, and relieve you of
your burden.”</p>

<p>The truth is, Hercules had a kind heart of his
own, and considered that he should be doing the
giant a favor, by allowing him this opportunity for
a ramble. And, besides, he thought that it would
be still more for his own glory, if he could boast of
upholding the sky, than merely to do so ordinary
a thing as to conquer a dragon with a hundred
heads. Accordingly, without more words, the sky
was shifted from the shoulders of Atlas, and placed
upon those of Hercules.</p>

<p>When this was safely accomplished, the first
thing that the giant did was to stretch himself;
and you may imagine what a prodigious spectacle
he was then. Next, he slowly lifted one of his feet
out of the forest that had grown up around it; then,
the other. Then, all at once, he began to caper,
and leap, and dance, for joy at his freedom; flinging
himself nobody knows how high into the air,
and floundering down again with a shock that made
the earth tremble. Then he laughed—Ho! ho! ho!—with
a thunderous roar that was echoed from the
mountains, far and near, as if they and the giant
had been so many rejoicing brothers. When his
joy had a little subsided, he stepped into the sea;
ten miles at the first stride, which brought him mid-leg
deep; and ten miles at the second, when the
water came just above his knees; and ten miles more
at the third, by which he was immersed nearly to
his waist. This was the greatest depth of the sea.</p>

<p>Hercules watched the giant, as he still went onward;
for it was really a wonderful sight, this immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
human form, more than thirty miles off, half
hidden in the ocean, but with his upper half as tall,
and misty, and blue, as a distant mountain. At
last the gigantic shape faded entirely out of view.
And now Hercules began to consider what he
should do, in case Atlas should be drowned in the
sea, or if he were to be stung to death by the dragon
with the hundred heads, which guarded the golden
apples of the Hesperides. If any such misfortune
were to happen, how could he ever get rid of the
sky? And, by the by, its weight began already to
be a little irksome to his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>“I really pity the poor giant,” thought Hercules.
“If it wearies me so much in ten minutes, how must
it have wearied him in a thousand years!”</p>

<p>O my sweet little people, you have no idea what
a weight there was in that same blue sky, which
looks so soft and aerial above our heads! And
there, too, was the bluster of the wind, and the
chill and watery clouds, and the blazing sun, all
taking their turns to make Hercules uncomfortable!
He began to be afraid that the giant would
never come back. He gazed wistfully at the
world beneath him, and acknowledged to himself
that it was a far happier kind of life to be a shepherd
at the foot of a mountain, than to stand on
its dizzy summit, and bear up the firmament with
his might and main. For, of course, as you will
easily understand, Hercules had an immense responsibility
on his mind, as well as a weight on his
head and shoulders. Why, if he did not stand perfectly
still, and keep the sky immovable, the sun
would perhaps be put ajar! Or, after nightfall, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
great many of the stars might be loosened from
their places, and shower down, like fiery rain, upon
the people’s heads! And how ashamed would the
hero be, if, owing to his unsteadiness beneath its
weight, the sky should crack, and show a great
fissure quite across it!</p>

<p>I know not how long it was before, to his unspeakable
joy, he beheld the huge shape of the
giant, like a cloud, on the far-off edge of the sea.
At his nearer approach, Atlas held up his hand, in
which Hercules could perceive three magnificent
golden apples, as big as pumpkins, all hanging
from one branch.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you again,” shouted Hercules,
when the giant was within hearing. “So you have
got the golden apples?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” answered Atlas; “and
very fair apples they are. I took the finest that
grew on the tree, I assure you. Ah! it is a beautiful
spot, that garden of the Hesperides. Yes;
and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight
worth any man’s seeing. After all, you had better
have gone for the apples yourself.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” replied Hercules. “You have had
a pleasant ramble, and have done the business as
well as I could. I heartily thank you for your
trouble. And now, as I have a long way to go,
and am rather in haste—and as the king, my cousin,
is anxious to receive the golden apples—will you
be kind enough to take the sky off my shoulders
again?”</p>

<p>“Why, as to that,” said the giant, chucking the
golden apples into the air twenty miles high, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
thereabouts and catching them as they came down—“as
to that, my good friend, I consider you a
little unreasonable. Cannot I carry the golden
apples to the king, your cousin, much quicker than
you could? As his majesty is in such a hurry to
get them, I promise you to take my longest strides.
And besides, I have no fancy for burdening myself
with the sky, just now.”</p>

<p>Here Hercules grew impatient, and gave a great
shrug of his shoulders. It being now twilight, you
might have seen two or three stars tumble out of
their places. Everybody on earth looked upward
in affright, thinking that the sky might be going to
fall next.</p>

<p>“Oh, that will never do!” cried Giant Atlas, with
a great roar of laughter. “I have not let fall so
many stars within the last five centuries. By the
time you have stood there as long as I did, you will
begin to learn patience!”</p>

<p>“What!” shouted Hercules, very wrathfully, “do
you intend to make me bear this burden forever?”</p>

<p>“We will see about that, one of these days,”
answered the giant. “At all events, you ought
not to complain, if you have to bear it the next
hundred years, or perhaps the next thousand. I
bore it a good while longer, in spite of the backache.
Well, then, after a thousand years, if I
happen to feel in the mood, we may possibly shift
about again. You are certainly a very strong man,
and can never have a better opportunity to prove
it. Posterity will talk of you, I warrant it!”</p>

<p>“Pish! a fig for its talk!” cried Hercules, with
another hitch of his shoulders. “Just take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sky upon your head one instant, will you? I
want to make a cushion of my lion’s skin, for the
weight to rest upon. It really chafes me, and will
cause unnecessary inconvenience in so many centuries
as I am to stand here.”</p>

<p>“That’s no more than fair, and I’ll do it!” quoth
the giant; for he had no unkind feeling towards
Hercules, and was merely acting with a too selfish
consideration of his own ease. “For just five
minutes, then, I’ll take back the sky. Only for five
minutes, recollect! I have no idea of spending another
thousand years as I spent the last. Variety
is the spice of life, say I.”</p>

<p>Ah, the thick-witted old rogue of a giant! He
threw down the golden apples, and received back
the sky, from the head and shoulders of Hercules,
upon his own, where it rightly belonged. And
Hercules picked up the three golden apples, that
were as big or bigger than pumpkins, and straightway
set out on his journey homeward, without paying
the slightest heed to the thundering tones of the
giant, who bellowed after him to come back. Another
forest sprang up around his feet, and grew
ancient there; and again might be seen oak-trees,
of six or seven centuries old, that had waxed thus
aged betwixt his enormous toes.</p>

<p>And there stands the giant to this day; or, at
any rate, there stands a mountain as tall as he,
and which bears his name; and when the thunder
rumbles about its summit, we may imagine it to
be the voice of Giant Atlas, bellowing after
Hercules!</p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_CUPID_AND_PSYCHE">THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE</h2>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="dropcap">A certain king and queen had three daughters.
The charms of the two elder were more
than common, but the beauty of the youngest was
so wonderful that the poverty of language is unable
to express its due praise. The fame of her beauty
was so great that strangers from neighboring
countries came in crowds to enjoy the sight, and
looked on her with amazement, paying her that
homage which is due only to Venus herself. In
fact Venus found her altars deserted, while men
turned their devotion to this young virgin. As she
passed along, the people sang her praises, and
strewed her way with chaplets and flowers.</p>

<p>This gave great offense to the real Venus.
Shaking her locks with indignation, she exclaimed,
“Am I then to be eclipsed in my honors by a mortal
girl? She shall not so quietly usurp my honors.
I will give her cause to repent of so unlawful a
beauty.”</p>

<p>Thereupon she calls her winged son Cupid, mischievous
enough in his own nature, and rouses and
provokes him yet more by her complaints. She
points out Psyche to him and says, “My dear son,
punish that obstinate beauty; give thy mother a
revenge as sweet as her injuries are great; infuse
into the bosom of that haughty girl a passion for
some low, mean, unworthy being, so that she may
reap a mortification as great as her present exultation
and triumph.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Cupid prepared to obey the commands of his
mother. There are two fountains in Venus’s garden,
one of sweet waters, the other of bitter. Cupid
filled two amber vases, one from each fountain, and
suspending them from the top of his quiver,
hastened to the chamber of Psyche, whom he found
asleep. He shed a few drops from the bitter
fountain over her lips, though the sight of her
almost moved him to pity; then touched her side
with the point of his arrow. At the touch she
awoke, and opened eyes upon Cupid (himself
invisible), which so startled him that in his confusion
he wounded himself with his own arrow.
Heedless of his wound, his whole thought now
was to repair the mischief he had done, and he
poured the balmy drops of joy over all her silken
ringlets.</p>

<p>Psyche, henceforth frowned upon by Venus, derived
no benefit from all her charms. True, all
eyes were cast eagerly upon her, and every mouth
spoke her praises; but neither king, royal youth,
nor plebeian presented himself to demand her in
marriage. Her two elder sisters of moderate
charms, had now long been married to two royal
princes; but Psyche, in her lonely apartment,
deplored her solitude, sick of that beauty which,
while it procured abundance of flattery, had failed
to awaken love.</p>

<p>Her parents, afraid they had incurred the anger
of the gods, consulted the oracle of Apollo, and
received this answer: “The virgin is destined
for the bride of no mortal lover. Her future
husband awaits her on the top of the mountain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
He is a monster whom neither gods nor men
can resist.”</p>

<p>This dreadful decree of the oracle filled all the
people with dismay, and her parents abandoned
themselves to grief. But Psyche said, “Why,
my dear parents, do you now lament me? You
should rather have grieved when the people
showered upon me undeserved honors, and with
one voice called me a Venus. I now perceive that I
am a victim to that name. I submit. Lead me
to that rock to which my unhappy fate has destined
me.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, all things being prepared, the royal
maid took her place in the procession, which more
resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp, and with
her parents, amid the lamentations of the people,
ascended the mountain, on the summit of which
they left her alone, and with sorrowful hearts
returned home.</p>

<p>While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain,
panting with fear and with eyes full of tears,
the gentle Zephyr raised her from the earth and
bore her with an easy motion into a flowery dale.
By degrees her mind became composed, and she
laid herself down on the grassy bank to sleep.
When she awoke refreshed with sleep, she looked
round and beheld near by a pleasant grove of tall
and stately trees. She entered it, and in the midst
discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and
crystal waters, and fast by, a magnificent palace
whose august front impressed the spectator that it
was not the work of mortal hands, but the happy
retreat of some god. Drawn by admiration and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
wonder, she approached the building and ventured
to enter. Every object she met filled her with
pleasure and amazement. Golden pillars supported
the vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with
carvings and paintings representing beasts of the
chase and rural scenes. Proceeding onward, she
perceived that besides the apartments of state there
were others filled with all manner of treasures, and
beautiful and precious productions of nature and
art.</p>

<p>While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice
addressed her, though she saw no one, uttering
these words: “Sovereign lady, all that you see is
yours. We whose voices you hear are your servants
and shall obey all your commands with our utmost
care and diligence. Retire, therefore, to your chamber
and repose on your bed of down, and when you
see fit repair to the bath. Supper awaits you in
the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to take
your seat there.”</p>

<p>Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal
attendants, and after repose and the refreshment
of the bath, seated herself in the alcove, where a
table immediately presented itself, without any
visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered
with the greatest delicacies of food. Her ears too
were feasted with music from invisible performers;
of whom one sang, another played on the lute, and
all closed in the wonderful harmony of a full
chorus.</p>

<p>She had not yet seen her destined husband. He
came only in the hours of darkness and fled before
the dawn of morning, but his accents were full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
love, and inspired a like passion in her. She often
begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he
would not consent. On the contrary he charged her
to make no attempt to see him, for it was his
pleasure, for the best of reasons, to keep concealed.
“Why should you wish to behold me?” he said;
“have you any doubt of my love? have you any wish
ungratified? If you saw me, perhaps you would
fear me, perhaps adore me, but all I ask of you is
to love me. I would rather you would love me as
an equal than adore me as a god.”</p>

<p>This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche for a
time, and while the novelty lasted she felt quite
happy. But at length the thought of her parents,
left in ignorance of her fate, and of her sisters,
preyed on her mind and made her begin to feel her
palace as but a splendid prison. When her husband
came one night, she told him her distress, and at
last drew from him an unwilling consent that her
sisters should be brought to see her.</p>

<p>So, calling Zephyr, she acquainted him with her
husband’s commands, and he, promptly obedient,
soon brought them across the mountain down to
their sister’s valley. They embraced her and she
returned their caresses. “Come,” said Psyche, “enter
with me my house and refresh yourselves with
whatever your sister has to offer.” Then taking
their hands she led them into her golden palace, and
committed them to the care of her numerous train
of attendant voices, to refresh them in her baths
and at her table, and to show them all her treasures.
The view of these celestial delights caused envy to
enter their bosoms, at seeing their young sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
possessed of such state and splendor, so much exceeding
their own.</p>

<p>They asked her numberless questions, among
others what sort of a person her husband was.
Psyche replied that he was a beautiful youth, who
generally spent the daytime in hunting upon the
mountains. The sisters, not satisfied with this
reply, soon made her confess that she had never
seen him. Then they proceeded to fill her mind
with dark suspicions. “Call to mind,” they said,
“the Pythian oracle that declared you destined to
marry a direful and tremendous monster. The
inhabitants of this valley say that your husband is
a terrible and monstrous serpent, who nourishes
you for a while with dainties that he may by and by
devour you. Take our advice. Provide yourself
with a lamp and a sharp knife; put them in concealment
that your husband may not discover them,
and when he is sound asleep, slip out of bed, bring
forth your lamp, and see for yourself whether what
they say is true or not. If it is, hesitate not to cut
off the monster’s head, and thereby recover your
liberty.”</p>

<p>Psyche resisted these persuasions as well as she
could, but they did not fail to have their effect on
her mind, and when her sisters were gone, their
words and her own curiosity were too strong for
her to resist. So she prepared her lamp and a sharp
knife, and hid them out of sight of her husband.
When he had fallen asleep, she silently rose and
uncovering her lamp beheld not a hideous monster,
but the most beautiful and charming of the gods,
with golden ringlets wandering over his snowy neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and crimson cheek, with two wings on his shoulders,
whiter than snow, and with shining feathers like the
tender blossoms of spring. As she leaned over to
have a nearer view of his face a drop of burning oil
fell on the shoulder of the god, startled with which
he opened his eyes and fixed them full upon her;
then, without saying one word, he spread his white
wings and flew out of the window. Psyche, in vain
endeavoring to follow him, fell from the window
to the ground. Cupid, beholding her as she lay in
the dust, stopped his flight for an instant and said,
“O foolish Psyche, is it thus you repay my love?
After having disobeyed my mother’s commands
and made you my wife, will you think me a monster
and cut off my head? But go; return to your
sisters, whose advice you seem to think preferable
to mine. I inflict no other punishment on you than
to leave you forever. Love cannot dwell with suspicion.”
So saying, he fled away, leaving poor
Psyche prostrate on the ground, filling the place
with mournful lamentations.</p>

<p>When she had recovered some degree of composure
she looked around her, but the palace and
gardens had vanished, and she found herself in the
open field not far from the city where her sisters
dwelt. She repaired thither and told them the
story of her misfortunes, at which, pretending to
grieve, those spiteful creatures inwardly rejoiced.
“For now,” said they, “he will perhaps choose one
of us.” With this idea, without saying a word of her
intentions, each of them rose early the next morning
and ascended the mountain, and having reached
the top, called upon Zephyr to receive her and bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
her to his lord; then leaping up, and not being sustained
by Zephyr, fell down the precipice and was
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>Psyche meanwhile wandered day and night, without
food or repose, in search of her husband. Casting
her eyes on a lofty mountain having on its brow
a magnificent temple, she sighed and said to herself,
“Perhaps my lord inhabits there,” and directed
her steps thither.</p>

<p>She had no sooner entered than she saw heaps
of corn, some in loose ears and some in sheaves, with
mingled ears of barley. Scattered about, lay sickles
and rakes, and all the instruments of harvest, without
order, as if thrown carelessly out of the weary
reapers’ hands in the sultry hours of the day.</p>

<p>This unseemly confusion Psyche put an end to,
by separating and sorting everything to its proper
place and kind, believing that she ought neglect
none of the gods, but endeavor by her piety to
engage them all in her behalf. The holy Ceres,
whose temple it was, finding her so religiously employed,
thus spoke to her: “O Psyche, truly worthy
of our pity, though I cannot shield you from the
frowns of Venus, yet I can teach you how best to
allay her displeasure. Go, then, and voluntarily
surrender yourself to your lady and sovereign, and
try by modesty and submission to win her forgiveness,
and perhaps her favor will restore you the
husband you have lost.”</p>

<p>Psyche obeyed the commands of Ceres and took
her way to the temple of Venus, endeavoring to
fortify her mind and ruminating on what she should
say and how best propitiate the angry goddess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
feeling that the issue was doubtful and perhaps
fatal.</p>

<p>Venus received her with angry countenance.
“Most undutiful and faithless of servants,” said
she, “do you at last remember that you really have
a mistress? Or have you rather come to see your
sick husband, yet laid up of the wound given him
by his loving wife? You are so ill-favored and disagreeable
that the only way you can merit your
lover must be by dint of industry and diligence. I
will make trial of your housewifery.” Then she
ordered Psyche to be led to the storehouse of her
temple, where was laid up a great quantity of
wheat, barley, millet, vetches, beans, and lentils
prepared for food for her pigeons, and said, “Take
and separate all these grains, putting all of the
same kind in a parcel by themselves, and see that
you get it done before evening.” Then Venus
departed and left her to her task.</p>

<p>But Psyche, in a perfect consternation at the
enormous work, sat stupid and silent, without
moving a finger to the inextricable heap.</p>

<p>While she sat despairing, Cupid stirred up the
little ant, a native of the fields, to take compassion
on her. The leader of the ant hill, followed by
whole hosts of his six-legged subjects, approached
the heap, and with the utmost diligence taking
grain by grain, they separated the pile, sorting
each kind to its parcel; and when it was all done,
they vanished out of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>Venus at the approach of twilight returned from
the banquet of the gods, breathing odors and
crowned with roses. Seeing the task done, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
exclaimed, “This is no work of yours, wicked one,
but his, whom to your own and his misfortune you
have enticed.” So saying, she threw her a piece of
black bread for her supper and went away.</p>

<p>Next morning Venus ordered Psyche to be called
and said to her, “Behold yonder grove which
stretches along the margin of the water. There you
will find sheep feeding without a shepherd, with
golden-shining fleeces on their backs. Go fetch me
a sample of that precious wool gathered from every
one of their fleeces.”</p>

<p>Psyche obediently went to the riverside, prepared
to do her best to execute the command. But
the river god inspired the reeds with harmonious
murmurs, which seemed to say, “O maiden,
severely tried, tempt not the dangerous flood, nor
venture among the formidable rams on the other
side, for as long as they are under the influence of
the rising sun, they burn with a cruel rage to destroy
mortals with their sharp horns or rude teeth. But
when the noontide sun has driven the cattle to the
shade, and the serene spirit of the flood has lulled
them to rest, you may then cross in safety, and you
will find the woolly gold sticking to the bushes and
the trunks of the trees.”</p>

<p>Thus the compassionate river god gave Psyche
instructions how to accomplish her task, and by
observing his directions she soon returned to Venus
with her arms full of the golden fleece; but she
received not the approbation of her implacable mistress,
who said, “I know very well that it is by
none of your own doings that you have succeeded
in this task, and I am not satisfied yet that you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
any capacity to make yourself useful. But I have
another task for you. Here, take this box and go
your way to the infernal shades, and give this box
to Proserpine and say, ‘My mistress Venus desires
you to send her a little of your beauty, for in tending
her sick son she has lost some of her own.’ Be
not too long on your errand, for I must paint
myself with it to appear at the circle of the gods
and goddesses this evening.”</p>

<p>Psyche was now satisfied that her destruction
was at hand, being obliged to go with her own feet
directly down to Erebus. Wherefore, to make no
delay of what was not to be avoided, she goes to the
top of a high tower to precipitate herself headlong,
thus to descend the shortest way to the shades
below. But a voice from the tower said to her,
“Why, poor unlucky girl, dost thou design to put
an end to thy days in so dreadful a manner? And
what cowardice makes thee sink under this last
danger who hast been so miraculously supported in
all thy former?” Then the voice told her how by a
certain cave she might reach the realms of Pluto,
and how to avoid all the dangers of the road, to pass
by Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and prevail on
Charon, the ferryman, to take her across the black
river and bring her back again. But the voice
added, “When Proserpine has given you the box
filled with her beauty, of all things this is chiefly to
be observed by you, that you never once open or
look into the box nor allow your curiosity to pry
into the treasure of the beauty of the goddesses.”</p>

<p>Psyche, encouraged by this advice, obeyed it in
all things, and taking heed to her ways travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
safely to the kingdom of Pluto. She was admitted
to the palace of Proserpine, and without accepting
the seat or delicious banquet that was offered her,
but contented with coarse bread for her food, she
delivered her message from Venus. Presently the
box was returned to her, shut and filled with the
precious commodity. Then she returned the way
she came, and glad was she to come out once more
into the light of day.</p>

<p>But having got so far successfully through her
dangerous task, a longing desire seized her to
examine the contents of the box. “What,” said
she, “shall I, the carrier of this divine beauty, not
take the least bit to put on my cheeks to appear to
more advantage in the eyes of my beloved husband!”
So she carefully opened the box, but found
nothing there of any beauty at all, but an infernal
and truly Stygian sleep, which being thus set free
from its prison, took possession of her, and she
fell down in the midst of the road, without sense
or motion.</p>

<p>But Cupid, being now recovered from his wound,
and not able longer to bear the absence of his
beloved Psyche, slipping through the smallest crack
of the window of his chamber which happened to
be left open, flew to the spot where Psyche lay, and
gathering up the sleep from her body closed it again
in the box, and waked Psyche with a light touch of
one of his arrows. “Again,” said he, “hast thou
almost perished by the same curiosity. But now
perform exactly the task imposed on you by my
mother, and I will take care of the rest.”</p>

<p>Then Cupid, as swift as lightning penetrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the heights of heaven, presented himself before
Jupiter with his supplication. Jupiter lent a
favoring ear, and pleaded the cause of the lovers
so earnestly with Venus that he won her consent.
On this he sent Mercury to bring Psyche up to the
heavenly assembly, and when she arrived, handing
her a cup of ambrosia, he said, “Drink this, Psyche,
and be immortal; nor shall Cupid ever break away
from the knot in which he is tied, but these nuptials
shall be perpetual.”</p>

<h2 id="HOW_PHAETON_DROVE_THE_SUN">HOW PHAËTON DROVE THE SUN</h2>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="dropcap">Phaëton was the son of Apollo and the
nymph Clymene. One day a schoolfellow
laughed at the idea of his being the son of the god,
and Phaëton went in rage and shame and reported
it to his mother. “If,” said he, “I am indeed of
heavenly birth, give me, mother, some proof of it,
and establish my claim to the honor.” Clymene
stretched forth her hands towards the skies, and
said, “I call to witness the Sun which looks down
upon us, that I have told you the truth. If I
speak falsely, let this be the last time I behold his
light. But it needs not much labor to go and
inquire for yourself; the land whence the Sun rises
lies next to ours. Go and demand of him whether
he will own you as a son.” Phaëton heard with
delight. He travelled to India, which lies directly
in the regions of sunrise; and, full of hope and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
pride, approached the goal whence his parent
begins his course.</p>

<p>The palace of the Sun stood reared aloft on
columns, glittering with gold and precious stones,
while polished ivory formed the ceilings, and silver
the doors. Upon the walls Vulcan had represented
earth, sea, and skies, with their inhabitants. In the
sea were the nymphs, some sporting in the waves,
some riding on the backs of fishes, while others sat
upon the rocks and dried their sea-green hair.
The earth had its towns and forests and rivers.
Over all was carved the likeness of the glorious
heaven; and on the silver doors the twelve signs of
the zodiac, six on each side.</p>

<p>Clymene’s son advanced up the steep ascent, and
entered the halls of his father. He approached the
paternal presence, but stopped at a distance, for
the light was more than he could bear. Phœbus,
arrayed in a purple vesture, sat on a throne, which
glittered as with diamonds. On his right hand and
his left stood the Day, the Month, and the Year,
and, at regular intervals, the Hours. Spring stood
with her head crowned with flowers, and Summer,
with a garland formed of spears of ripened grain,
and Autumn, with his feet stained with grape-juice,
and icy Winter, with his hair stiffened with
hoar frost.</p>

<p>Surrounded by these attendants, the Sun, with
the eye that sees everything, beheld the youth
dazzled with the novelty and splendor of the
scene, and inquired the purpose of his errand.
The youth replied, “O light of the boundless world,
Phœbus, my father—if you permit me to use that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
name—give me some proof, I beseech you, by
which I may be known as yours.” He ceased; and
his father, laying aside the beams that shone all
around his head, bade him approach, and embracing
him, said, “My son, you deserve not to be
disowned, and I confirm what your mother has told
you. To put an end to your doubts, ask what you
will, the gift shall be yours. I call to witness that
dreadful lake, which I never saw, but which we
gods swear by in our most solemn engagements.”
Phaëton immediately asked to be permitted for one
day to drive the chariot of the Sun. The father
repented of his promise; thrice and four times he
shook his radiant head in warning. “I have spoken
rashly,” said he; “this request only I would deny.
I beg you to withdraw it. It is not a safe boon, nor
one, my Phaëton, suited to your youth and
strength. Your lot is mortal, and you ask what is
beyond a mortal’s power. In your ignorance you
aspire to do that which not even the gods themselves
may do. None but myself may drive the
flaming car of day. Not even Jupiter, whose
terrible right arm hurls the thunderbolts. The first
part of the way is steep, and such as the horses
when fresh in the morning can hardly climb; the
middle is high up in the heavens, whence I myself
can scarcely, without alarm, look down and behold
the earth and sea stretched beneath me. The last
part of the road descends rapidly, and requires
most careful driving. Tethys, who is waiting to
receive me, often trembles for me lest I should fall
headlong. Add to all this, the heaven is all the
time turning round and carrying the stars with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
I have to be perpetually on my guard lest that
movement, which sweeps everything else along,
should hurry me also away. Suppose I should
lend you the chariot, what would you do? Could
you keep your course while the earth was revolving
under you? Perhaps you think that there are forests
and cities, the abodes of gods, and palaces and
temples on the way. On the contrary, the road is
through the midst of frightful monsters. You pass
by the horns of the Bull, in front of the Archer, and
near the Lion’s jaws, and where the Scorpion
stretches its arms in one direction and the Crab in
another. Nor will you find it easy to guide those
horses, with their breasts full of fire that they
breathe forth from their mouths and nostrils. I
can scarcely govern them myself, when they are unruly
and resist the reins. Beware, my son, lest I
be the donor of a fatal gift, recall your request while
yet you may. Do you ask me for a proof that you
are sprung from my blood? I give you a proof in
my fears for you. Look at my face—I would that
you could look into my heart, you would there see
all a father’s anxiety. Finally,” he continued,
“look round the world and choose whatever you will
of what earth or sea contains most precious—ask it
and fear no refusal. This only I pray you not to
urge. It is not honor, but destruction you seek.
Why do you hang round my neck and still entreat
me? You shall have it if you persist—the oath is
sworn and must be kept—but I beg you to choose
more wisely.”</p>

<p>He ended; but the youth rejected all admonition
and held to his demand. So, having resisted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
long as he could, Phœbus at last led the way to
where stood the lofty chariot.</p>

<p>It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan; the axle was
of gold, the pole and wheels of gold, the spokes of
silver. Along the seat were rows of chrysolites
and diamonds which reflected the brightness of the
sun. While the daring youth gazed in admiration,
the early Dawn threw open the purple doors of the
east, and showed the pathway strewn with roses.
The stars withdrew, marshalled by the Day-star,
which last of all retired also. The father, when he
saw the earth beginning to glow, and the Moon
preparing to retire, ordered the Hours to harness
up the horses. They obeyed, and led forth the
steeds from the lofty stalls, and attached the reins.
Then the father bathed the face of his son with a
powerful ointment, and made him capable of
enduring the brightness of the flame. He set the
rays on his head, and, with a foreboding sigh, said,
“If, my son, you will in this at least heed my advice,
spare the whip and hold tight the reins. They go
fast enough of their own accord; the labor is to hold
them in. You are not to take the straight road
directly between the five circles, but turn off to the
left. Keep within the limit of the middle zone,
and avoid the northern and the southern alike. You
will see the marks of the wheels, and they will serve
to guide you. And, that the skies and the earth
may each receive their due share of heat, go not
too high, or you will burn the heavenly dwellings,
nor too low, or you will set the earth on fire; the
middle course is safest and best. And now I leave
you to your chance, which I hope will plan better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
for you than you have done for yourself. Night
is passing out of the western gates and we can
delay no longer. Take the reins; but if at last
your heart fails you, and you will benefit by my
advice, stay where you are in safety, and suffer
me to light and warm the earth.” The agile youth
sprang into the chariot, stood erect, and grasped
the reins with delight, pouring out thanks to his
reluctant parent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the horses fill the air with their snortings
and fiery breath, and stamp the ground impatiently.
Now the bars are let down, and the
boundless plain of the universe lies open before
them. They dart forward and cleave the opposing
clouds, and outrun the morning breezes which
started from the same eastern goal. The steeds
soon perceived that the load they drew was lighter
than usual; and as a ship without ballast is tossed
hither and thither on the sea, so the chariot, without
its accustomed weight, was dashed about as
if empty. They rush headlong and leave the
travelled road. Phaëton is alarmed, and knows
not how to guide them; nor, if he knew, has he
the power. Then, for the first time, the Great and
Little Bear were scorched with heat, and would
fain, if it were possible, have plunged into the
water; and the Serpent which lies coiled up round
the north pole, torpid and harmless, grew warm,
and with warmth felt its rage revive.</p>

<p>When Phaëton looked down upon the earth,
now spreading in vast extent beneath him, he grew
pale and his knees shook with terror. In spite
of the glare all around him, the sight of his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
grew dim. He wished he had never touched his
father’s horses, never learned his parentage,
never prevailed in his request. He is borne along
like a vessel that flies before a tempest, when the
pilot can do no more. What shall he do? Much
of the heavenly road is left behind, but more
remains before. He turns his eyes from one direction
to the other; now to the goal whence he
began his course, now to the realms of sunset which
he is not destined to reach. He loses his self-command,
and knows not what to do—whether to
draw tight the reins or throw them loose; he forgets
the names of the horses. He sees with terror the
monstrous forms scattered over the surface of
heaven. Here the Scorpion extended his two great
arms, with his tail and crooked claws stretching
over two signs of the zodiac. When the boy beheld
him, reeking with poison and menacing with his
fangs, his courage failed, and the reins fell from
his hands. The horses, when they felt them loose
on their backs, dashed headlong, and unrestrained
went off into unknown regions of the sky, in
among the stars, hurling the chariot over pathless
places, now up in high heaven, now down almost
to the earth. The Moon saw with astonishment her
brother’s chariot running beneath her own. The
clouds begin to smoke, and the mountain tops take
fire; the fields are parched with heat, the plants
wither, the trees with their leafy branches burn,
the harvest is ablaze! But these are small things.
Great cities perished, with their walls and towers;
whole nations with their people were consumed to
ashes! Then Phaëton beheld the world on fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and felt the heat intolerable. The air he breathed
was like the air of a furnace and full of burning
ashes, and the smoke was of a pitchy darkness. He
dashed forward he knew not whither. Then, it is
believed, the people of Æthiopia became black by
the blood being forced so suddenly to the surface,
and the Libyan desert was dried up to the condition
in which it remains to this day. The Nymphs of
the fountains, with dishevelled hair, mourned their
waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath their banks.
The Nile fled away and hid his head in the desert,
and there it still remains concealed. Where he
used to discharge his waters through seven mouths
into the sea, there seven dry channels alone remained.
The earth cracked open, and through the
chinks light broke into Tartarus, and frightened
the King of Shadows and his queen. The sea
shrank up. Where before was water, it became a
dry plain; and the mountains that lie beneath the
waves lifted up their heads and became islands.
The fishes sought the lowest depths, and the
dolphins no longer ventured as usual to sport on
the surface. Thrice Neptune essayed to raise his
head above the surface, and thrice was driven back
by the heat. Earth, surrounded as she was by
waters, yet with head and shoulders bare, screening
her face with her hand, looked up to heaven, and
with a husky voice called on Jupiter:</p>

<p>“O ruler of the gods, if I have deserved this
treatment, and it is your will that I perish with fire,
why withhold your thunderbolts? Let me at least
fall by your hand. Is this the reward of my
fertility, of my obedient service? Is it for this that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
I have supplied herbage for cattle, and fruits for
men, and frankincense for your altars? But if I
am unworthy of regard, what has my brother
Ocean done to deserve such a fate? If neither of
us can excite your pity, think, I pray you, of your
own heaven, and behold how both the poles are
smoking which sustain your palace, which must
fall if they be destroyed. Atlas faints, and scarce
holds up his burden. If sea, earth, and heaven
perish, we fall into ancient Chaos. Save what yet
remains to us from the devouring flame. Oh, take
thought for our deliverance in this awful moment!”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Earth, and overcome with heat and
thirst, could say no more. Then Jupiter omnipotent,
calling to witness all the gods, including him
who had lent the chariot, and showing them that
all was lost unless some speedy remedy were
applied, mounted the lofty tower from whence he
diffuses clouds over the earth, and hurls the forked
lightnings. But at that time not a cloud was to be
found to interpose for a screen to earth, nor was
a shower remaining unexhausted. He thundered,
and brandishing a lightning bolt in his right hand
launched it against the charioteer, and struck him
at the same moment from his seat and from existence!
Phaëton, with his hair on fire, fell headlong,
like a shooting star which marks the heavens with
its brightness as it falls, and Eridanus, the great
river, received him and cooled his burning frame.</p>

<h2 id="BAUCIS_AND_PHILEMON_WHO_WERE">BAUCIS AND PHILEMON, WHO WERE
CHANGED INTO TWO TREES</h2>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="dropcap">On a certain hill in Phrygia stands a linden
tree and an oak, enclosed by a low wall.
Not far from the spot is a marsh, formerly good
habitable land, but now indented with pools, the
resort of fen-birds and cormorants. Once on a
time Jupiter, in human shape, visited this country,
and with him his son Mercury, without his
wings.</p>

<p>They presented themselves, as weary travellers,
at many a door, seeking rest and shelter, but found
all closed, for it was late, and the inhospitable inhabitants
would not rouse themselves to open for
their reception.</p>

<p>At last a humble mansion received them, a small
thatched cottage, where Baucis, a pious old dame,
and her husband Philemon had grown old together.
Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it
endurable by moderate desires and kind dispositions.
One need not look there for master or for
servant; they two were the whole household, master
and servant alike.</p>

<p>When the two heavenly guests crossed the
humble threshold, and bowed their heads to pass
under the low door, the old man placed a seat,
on which Baucis, bustling and attentive, spread a
cloth, and begged them to sit down. Then she
raked out the coals from the ashes and kindled up
a fire, fed it with leaves and dry bark, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
her scanty breath blew it into a flame. She brought
out of a corner split sticks and dry branches, broke
them up, and placed them under the small kettle.
Her husband collected some pot-herbs in the
garden and she shred them from the stalks and
prepared them for the pot. He reached down
with a forked stick a flitch of bacon hanging in the
chimney, cut a small piece, and put it in the pot
to boil with the herbs, setting away the rest for
another time. A beechen bowl was filled with
warm water, that their guests might wash. While
all was doing, they beguiled the time with conversation.</p>

<p>On the bench designed for the guests was laid
a cushion stuffed with seaweed; and a cloth, only
produced on great occasions, but ancient and coarse
enough, was spread over that. The old lady, with
her apron on, with trembling hand set the table.
One leg was shorter than the rest, but a piece of
slate put under restored the level. When fixed,
she rubbed the table down with some sweet-smelling
herbs. Upon it she set some olives, some berries
preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and
cheese, with eggs lightly cooked in the ashes. All
were served in earthen dishes, and an earthenware
pitcher, with wooden cups, stood beside them.
When all was ready, the stew, smoking hot, was
set on the table. Some wine, not of the oldest,
was added; and for dessert, apples and wild honey;
and over and above all, friendly faces, and simple
but hearty welcome.</p>

<p>Now while the repast proceeded, the old folks
were astonished to see that the wine, as fast as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
was poured out, renewed itself in the pitcher, of
its own accord.</p>

<p>Struck with terror, Baucis and Philemon recognized
their heavenly guests, fell on their knees, and
with clasped hands implored forgiveness for their
poor entertainment.</p>

<p>There was an old goose, which they kept as the
guardian of their humble cottage; and they bethought
them to make this a sacrifice in honor of
their guests. But the goose, too nimble, with the
aid of feet and wings, for the old folks, eluded
their pursuit, and at last took shelter between the
gods themselves.</p>

<p>They forbade it to be slain; and spoke in these
words: “We are gods. This inhospitable village
shall pay the penalty of its impiety; you alone shall
go free from the chastisement. Quit your house,
and come with us to the top of yonder hill.”</p>

<p>They hastened to obey, and, staff in hand,
labored up the steep ascent. They had reached
to within an arrow’s flight of the top, when
turning their eyes below, they beheld all the
country sunk in a lake, only their own house left
standing.</p>

<p>While they gazed with wonder at the sight, and
lamented the fate of their neighbors, that old house
of theirs was changed into a <em>temple</em>. Columns took
the place of the corner posts, the thatch grew yellow
and appeared a gilded roof, the floors became
marble, the doors were enriched with carving and
ornaments of gold.</p>

<p>Then spoke Jupiter in benignant accents:
“Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
husband, speak, tell us your wishes; what favor
have you to ask of us?”</p>

<p>Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few moments;
then declared to the gods their united wish:
“We ask to be priests and guardians of this your
temple; and since here we have passed our lives in
love and concord, we wish that one and the same
hour may take us both from life, that I may not
live to see her grave, nor be laid in my own by her.”
Their prayer was granted. They were the keepers
of the temple as long as they lived.</p>

<p>When grown very old, as they stood one day before
the steps of the sacred edifice, and were telling
the story of the place, Baucis saw Philemon begin
to put forth leaves, and old Philemon saw Baucis
changing in like manner. And now a leafy crown
had grown over their heads while exchanging parting
words, as long as they could speak. “Farewell,
dear spouse,” they said, together, and at the same
moment the bark closed over their mouths. The
Tyanean shepherd still shows the two trees, standing
side by side, made out of the two good old
people.</p>

<h2 id="THE_PARADISE_OF_CHILDREN">THE PARADISE OF CHILDREN</h2>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">Long, long ago, when this old world was in
its tender infancy, there was a child, named
Epimetheus, who never had either father or mother;
and, that he might not be lonely, another child,
fatherless and motherless like himself, was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
from a far country to live with him, and be his
playfellow and helpmate. Her name was Pandora.</p>

<p>The first thing that Pandora saw when she entered
the cottage where Epimetheus dwelt was a
great box. And almost the first question which
she put to him after crossing the threshold
was this: “Epimetheus, what have you in that
box?”</p>

<p>“My dear little Pandora,” answered Epimetheus,
“that is a secret, and you must be kind enough not
to ask any questions about it. The box was left
here to be kept safely, and I do not myself know
what it contains.”</p>

<p>“But who gave it to you?” asked Pandora. “And
where did it come from?”</p>

<p>“That is a secret, too,” replied Epimetheus.</p>

<p>“How provoking!” exclaimed Pandora, pouting
her lip. “I wish the great ugly box were out of
the way!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, don’t think of it any more,” cried
Epimetheus. “Let us run out of doors and have
some nice play with the other children.”</p>

<p>It is thousands of years since Epimetheus and
Pandora were alive; and the world nowadays is a
very different sort of thing from what it was in
their time. Then everybody was a child. There
needed no fathers and mothers to take care of the
children, because there was no danger nor trouble
of any kind, and no clothes to be mended, and there
was always plenty to eat and drink. Whenever a
child wanted his dinner he found it growing on a
tree; and, if he looked at the tree in the morning,
he could see the expanding blossom of that night’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
supper; or, at eventide, he saw the tender bud of
to-morrow’s breakfast. It was a very pleasant life
indeed. No labor to be done, no tasks to be
studied; nothing but sports and dances, and sweet
voices of children talking, or carolling like birds,
or gushing out in merry laughter throughout the
livelong day.</p>

<p>What was most wonderful of all, the children
never quarrelled among themselves; neither had
they any crying fits; nor, since time first began,
had a single one of these little mortals ever gone
apart into a corner, and sulked. Oh, what a good
time was that to be alive in! The truth is, those
ugly little winged monsters, called Troubles, which
are now almost as numerous as mosquitoes, had
never yet been seen on the earth. It is probable
that the very greatest disquietude which a child had
ever experienced was Pandora’s vexation at not
being able to discover the secret of the mysterious
box.</p>

<p>This was at first only the faint shadow of a
Trouble; but, every day, it grew more and more
substantial, until, before a great while, the cottage
of Epimetheus and Pandora was less sunshiny
than those of the other children.</p>

<p>“Whence can the box have come?” Pandora continually
kept saying to herself and to Epimetheus.
“And what in the world can be inside of it?”</p>

<p>“Always talking about this box!” said Epimetheus,
at last; for he had grown extremely tired
of the subject. “I wish, dear Pandora, you would
try to talk of something else. Come, let us go and
gather some ripe figs, and eat them under the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
for our supper. And I know a vine that has the
sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever tasted.”</p>

<p>“Always talking about grapes and figs!” cried
Pandora, pettishly.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Epimetheus, who was a very
good-tempered child, like a multitude of children
in those days, “let us run out and have a merry
time with our playmates.”</p>

<p>“I am tired of merry times, and don’t care if I
never have any more!” answered our pettish little
Pandora. “And, besides, I never do have any.
This ugly box! I am so taken up with thinking
about it all the time. I insist upon your telling
me what is inside of it.”</p>

<p>“As I have already said, fifty times over, I do
not know!” replied Epimetheus, getting a little
vexed. “How, then, can I tell you what is inside?”</p>

<p>“You might open it,” said Pandora, looking sideways
at Epimetheus, “and then we could see for
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Pandora, what are you thinking of?” exclaimed
Epimetheus.</p>

<p>And his face expressed so much horror at the
idea of looking into a box, which had been confided
to him on the condition of his never opening it, that
Pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more.
Still, however, she could not help thinking and talking
about the box. “At least,” said she, “you can
tell me how it came here.”</p>

<p>“It was left at the door,” replied Epimetheus,
“just before you came, by a person who looked
very smiling and intelligent, and who could hardly
forbear laughing as he put it down. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
dressed in an odd kind of a cloak, and had on a cap
that seemed to be made partly of feathers, so that
it looked almost as if it had wings.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a staff had he?” asked Pandora.</p>

<p>“Oh, the most curious staff you ever saw!” cried
Epimetheus. “It was like two serpents twisting
around a stick, and was carved so naturally that I,
at first, thought the serpents were alive.”</p>

<p>“I know him,” said Pandora, thoughtfully.
“Nobody else has such a staff. It was Quicksilver;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and he brought me hither, as well as the
box. No doubt he intended it for me; and, most
probably, it contains pretty dresses for me to wear,
or toys for you and me to play with, or something
very nice for us both to eat!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” answered Epimetheus, turning
away. “But until Quicksilver comes back and
tells us so, we have neither of us any right to lift
the lid of the box.”</p>

<p>“What a dull boy he is!” muttered Pandora, as
Epimetheus left the cottage. “I do wish he had a
little more enterprise!”</p>

<p>For the first time since her arrival, Epimetheus
had gone out without asking Pandora to accompany
him. He went to gather figs and grapes by himself,
or to seek whatever amusement he could find,
in other society than his little playfellow’s. He
was tired to death of hearing about the box, and
heartily wished that Quicksilver, or whatever was
the messenger’s name, had left it at some other
child’s door, where Pandora would never have set
eyes on it. So perseveringly as she did babble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
about this one thing! The box, the box, and nothing
but the box! It seemed as if the box were bewitched,
and as if the cottage were not big enough
to hold it, without Pandora’s continually stumbling
over it, and making Epimetheus stumble over it
likewise, and bruising all four of their shins.</p>

<p>Well, it was really hard that poor Epimetheus
should have a box in his ears from morning till
night; especially as the little people of the earth
were so unaccustomed to vexations, in those happy
days, that they knew not how to deal with them.
Thus, a small vexation made as much disturbance
then, as a far bigger one would in our own times.</p>

<p>After Epimetheus was gone, Pandora stood
gazing at the box. She had called it ugly, above
a hundred times; but, in spite of all that she had
said against it, it was positively a very handsome
article of furniture, and would have been quite an
ornament to any room in which it should be placed.
It was made of a beautiful kind of wood, with dark
and rich veins spreading over its surface, which
was so highly polished that little Pandora could
see her face in it. As the child had no other looking-glass,
it is odd that she did not value the box,
merely on this account.</p>

<p>The edges and corners of the box were carved
with most wonderful skill. Around the margin
there were figures of graceful men and women, and
the prettiest children ever seen, reclining or sporting
amid a profusion of flowers and foliage; and
these various objects were so exquisitely represented,
and were wrought together in such harmony,
that flowers, foliage, and human beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty.
But here and there, peeping forth from behind the
carved foliage, Pandora once or twice fancied that
she saw a face not so lovely, or something or other
that was disagreeable, and which stole the beauty
out of all the rest. Nevertheless on looking more
closely, and touching the spot with her finger, she
could discover nothing of the kind. Some face,
that was really beautiful, had been made to look
ugly by her catching a sideway glimpse at it.</p>

<p>The most beautiful face of all was done in what
is called high relief, in the center of the lid. There
was nothing else, save the dark, smooth richness
of the polished wood, and this one face in the center
with a garland of flowers about its brow. Pandora
had looked at this face a great many times, and
imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked, or
be grave when it chose, the same as any living
mouth. The features, indeed, all wore a very
lively and rather mischievous expression, which
looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the
carved lips, and utter itself in words.</p>

<p>Had the mouth spoken, it would probably have
been something like this: “Do not be afraid, Pandora!
What harm can there be in opening the
box? Never mind that poor, simple Epimetheus!
You are wiser than he, and have ten times as much
spirit. Open the box, and see if you do not find
something very pretty!”</p>

<p>The box, I had almost forgotten to say, was
fastened; not by a lock, nor by any other such
contrivance, but by a very intricate knot of gold
cord. There appeared to be no end to this knot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and no beginning. Never was a knot so cunningly
twisted, nor with so many ins and outs, which
roguishly defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle
them. And yet, by the very difficulty that
there was in it, Pandora was the more tempted to
examine the knot, and just see how it was made.
Two or three times, already, she had stooped over
the box, and taken the knot between her thumb
and forefinger, but without positively trying to
undo it.</p>

<p>“I really believe,” said she to herself, “that I
begin to see how it was done. Nay, perhaps I
could tie it up again, after undoing it. There
would be no harm in that, surely. Even Epimetheus
would not blame me for that. I need not open
the box, and should not, of course, without the
foolish boy’s consent, even if the knot were untied.”</p>

<p>It might have been better for Pandora if she had
had a little work to do, or anything to employ her
mind upon, so as not to be so constantly thinking
of this one subject. But children led so easy a life,
before any Troubles came into the world, that they
had really a great deal too much leisure. They
could not be forever playing at hide-and-seek
among the flower-shrubs, or at blind-man’s-buff
with garlands over their eyes, or at whatever other
games had been found out, while Mother Earth
was in her babyhood. When life is all sport, toil is
the real play. There was absolutely nothing to do.
A little sweeping and dusting about the cottage, I
suppose, and the gathering of fresh flowers (which
were only too abundant everywhere), and arranging
them in vases—and poor little Pandora’s day’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
work was over. And then, for the rest of the day,
there was the box!</p>

<p>After all, I am not quite sure that the box was
not a blessing to her in its way. It supplied her
with such a variety of ideas to think of, and to talk
about, whenever she had anybody to listen! When
she was in good humor, she could admire the bright
polish of its sides, and the rich border of beautiful
faces and foliage that ran all around it. Or, if she
chanced to be ill-tempered, she could give it a push,
or kick it with her naughty little foot. And many a
kick did the box—(but it was a mischievous box, as
we shall see, and deserved all it got)—many a kick
did it receive. But, certain it is, if it had not been
for the box, our active-minded little Pandora would
not have known half so well how to spend her time
as she now did.</p>

<p>For it was really an endless employment to guess
what was inside. What could it be, indeed? Just
imagine, my little hearers, how busy your wits
would be, if there were a great box in the house,
which, as you might have reason to suppose, contained
something new and pretty for your Christmas
or New Year’s gifts. Do you think that you
should be less curious than Pandora? If you were
left alone with the box, might you not feel a little
tempted to lift the lid? But you would not do it.
Oh, fie! No, no! Only, if you thought there were
toys in it, it would be so very hard to let slip an
opportunity of taking just one peep! I know not
whether Pandora expected any toys; for none had
yet begun to be made, probably, in those days, when
the world itself was one great plaything for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
children that dwelt upon it. But Pandora was convinced
that there was something very beautiful and
valuable in the box; and therefore she felt just as
anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls,
here around me, would have felt. And, possibly,
a little more so; but of that I am not quite so
certain.</p>

<p>On this particular day, however, which we have
so long been talking about, her curiosity grew so
much greater than it usually was, that, at last, she
approached the box. She was more than half determined
to open it, if she could. Ah, naughty Pandora!</p>

<p>First, however, she tried to lift it. It was heavy;
quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child,
like Pandora. She raised one end of the box a few
inches from the floor, and let it fall again, with a
pretty loud thump. A moment afterwards, she
almost fancied that she heard something stir inside
of the box. She applied her ear as closely as possible,
and listened. Positively, there did seem to be
a kind of stifled murmur within! Or was it merely
the singing in Pandora’s ears? Or could it be the
beating of her heart? The child could not quite
satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or
no. But, at all events, her curiosity was stronger
than ever.</p>

<p>As she drew back her head, her eyes fell upon the
knot of gold cord.</p>

<p>“It must have been a very ingenious person who
tied this knot,” said Pandora to herself. “But I
think I could untie it nevertheless. I am resolved,
at least, to find the two ends of the cord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>So she took the golden knot in her fingers, and
pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could.
Almost without intending it, or quite knowing
what she was about, she was soon busily engaged in
attempting to undo it. Meanwhile, the bright sunshine
came through the open window; as did likewise
the merry voices of the children, playing at a
distance, and perhaps the voice of Epimetheus
among them. Pandora stopped to listen. What
a beautiful day it was! Would it not be wiser, if
she were to let the troublesome knot alone, and
think no more about the box, but run and join her
little playfellows, and be happy?</p>

<p>All this time, however, her fingers were half unconsciously
busy with the knot; and happening to
glance at the flower-wreathed face on the lid of the
enchanted box, she seemed to perceive it slyly grinning
at her.</p>

<p>“That face looks very mischievous,” thought
Pandora. “I wonder whether it smiles because I
am doing wrong! I have the greatest mind in the
world to run away!”</p>

<p>But just then, by the merest accident, she gave
the knot a kind of a twist, which produced a
wonderful result. The gold cord untwined itself
as if by magic, and left the box without a
fastening.</p>

<p>“This is the strangest thing I ever knew!” said
Pandora. “What will Epimetheus say? And how
can I possibly tie it up again?”</p>

<p>She made one or two attempts to restore the
knot, but soon found it quite beyond her skill. It
had disentangled itself so suddenly that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
not in the least remember how the strings had been
doubled into one another; and when she tried to
recollect the shape and appearance of the knot, it
seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind.
Nothing was to be done, therefore, but to let the
box remain as it was until Epimetheus should
come in.</p>

<p>“But,” said Pandora, “when he finds the knot
untied, he will know that I have done it. How
shall I make him believe that I have not looked
into the box?”</p>

<p>And then the thought came into her naughty
little heart, that, since she would be suspected of
having looked into the box, she might just as well
do so at once. Oh, very naughty and very foolish
Pandora! You should have thought only of doing
what was right, and of leaving undone what was
wrong, and not of what your playfellow Epimetheus
would have said or believed. And so perhaps
she might, if the enchanted face on the lid of the
box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at
her, and if she had not seemed to hear, more distinctly
than before, the murmur of small voices
within. She could not tell whether it was fancy
or no; but there was quite a little tumult of
whispers in her ear—or else it was her curiosity
that whispered—“Let us out, dear Pandora—pray
let us out! We will be such nice pretty playfellows
for you! Only let us out!”</p>

<p>“What can it be?” thought Pandora. “Is there
something alive in the box? Well!—yes!—I am
resolved to take just one peep! Only one peep;
and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
ever! There cannot possibly be any harm in just
one little peep!”</p>

<p>But it is now time for us to see what Epimetheus
was doing.</p>

<p>This was the first time, since his little playmate
had come to dwell with him, that he had attempted
to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake.
But nothing went right; nor was he nearly so happy
as on other days. He could not find a sweet grape
or a ripe fig (if Epimetheus had a fault, it was a
little too much fondness for figs); or, if ripe at all,
they were overripe, and so sweet as to be cloying.
There was no mirth in his heart, such as usually
made his voice gush out, of its own accord, and
swell the merriment of his companions. In short,
he grew so uneasy and discontented, that the other
children could not imagine what was the matter
with Epimetheus. Neither did he himself know
what ailed him, any better than they did. For you
must recollect that, at the time we are speaking of,
it was everybody’s nature, and constant habit, to be
happy. The world had not yet learned to be otherwise.
Not a single soul or body, since these children
were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful
earth, had ever been sick or out of sorts.</p>

<p>At length, discovering that, somehow or other, he
put a stop to all the play, Epimetheus judged it
best to go back to Pandora, who was in a humor
better suited to his own. But, with a hope of giving
her pleasure, he gathered some flowers, and made
them into a wreath, which he meant to put upon
her head. The flowers were very lovely—roses,
and lilies, and orange-blossoms, and a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
more, which left a trail of fragrance behind, as Epimetheus
carried them along; and the wreath was
put together with as much skill as could reasonably
be expected of a boy. The fingers of little girls, it
has always appeared to me, are the fittest to twine
flower-wreaths; but boys could do it, in those days,
rather better than they can now.</p>

<p>And here I must mention that a great black
cloud had been gathering in the sky, for some time
past, although it had not yet overspread the sun.
But, just as Epimetheus reached the cottage door,
this cloud began to intercept the sunshine, and thus
to make a sudden and sad obscurity.</p>

<p>He entered softly; for he meant, if possible, to
steal behind Pandora, and fling the wreath of
flowers over her head, before she should be aware
of his approach. But, as it happened, there was no
need of his treading so very lightly. He might have
trod as heavily as he pleased—as heavily as a grown
man—as heavily, I was going to say, as an elephant—without
much probability of Pandora’s
hearing his footsteps. She was too intent upon her
purpose. At the moment of his entering the cottage,
the naughty child had put her hand to the lid,
and was on the point of opening the mysterious
box. Epimetheus beheld her. If he had cried out,
Pandora would probably have withdrawn her hand,
and the fatal mystery of the box might never have
been known.</p>

<p>But Epimetheus himself, although he said very
little about it, had his own share of curiosity to
know what was inside. Perceiving that Pandora
was resolved to find out the secret, he determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
that his playfellow should not be the only wise
person in the cottage. And if there were anything
pretty or valuable in the box, he meant to take half
of it to himself. Thus, after all his sage speeches
to Pandora about restraining her curiosity, Epimetheus
turned out to be quite as foolish, and
nearly as much in fault, as she. So, whenever we
blame Pandora for what happened, we must not
forget to shake our heads at Epimetheus likewise.</p>

<p>As Pandora raised the lid, the cottage grew very
dark and dismal; for the black cloud had now
swept quite over the sun, and seemed to have buried
it alive. There had, for a little while past, been a
low growling and muttering, which all at once
broke into a heavy peal of thunder. But Pandora,
heeding nothing of all this, lifted the lid nearly upright,
and looked inside. It seemed as if a sudden
swarm of winged creatures brushed past her, taking
flight out of the box, while, at the same instant, she
heard the voice of Epimetheus, with a lamentable
tone, as if he were in pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am stung!” cried he. “I am stung!
Naughty Pandora! why have you opened this
wicked box?”</p>

<p>Pandora let fall the lid, and, starting up, looked
about her, to see what had befallen Epimetheus.
The thunder-cloud had so darkened the room that
she could not very clearly discern what was in it.
But she heard a disagreeable buzzing, as if a great
many huge flies, or gigantic mosquitoes, or those
insects which we call dor-bugs, and pinching-dogs,
were darting about. And, as her eyes grew more
accustomed to the imperfect light, she saw a crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
of ugly little shapes, with bats’ wings, looking
abominably spiteful, and armed with terribly long
stings in their tails. It was one of these that had
stung Epimetheus. Nor was it a great while before
Pandora herself began to scream, in no less pain
and affright than her playfellow, and making a
vast deal more hubbub about it. An odious little
monster had settled on her forehead, and would
have stung her I know not how deeply, if Epimetheus
had not run and brushed it away.</p>

<p>Now, if you wish to know what these ugly things
might be, which had made their escape out of the
box, I must tell you that they were the whole family
of earthly Troubles. There were evil Passions;
there were a great many species of Cares; there
were more than a hundred and fifty Sorrows; there
were Diseases, in a vast number of miserable and
painful shapes; there were more kinds of Naughtiness
than it would be of any use to talk about. In
short, everything that has since afflicted the souls
and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the
mysterious box, and given to Epimetheus and Pandora
to be kept safely, in order that the happy
children of the world might never be molested by
them. Had they been faithful to their trust, all
would have gone well. No grown person would
ever have been sad, nor any child have had cause
to shed a single tear, from that hour until this
moment.</p>

<p>But—and you may see by this how a wrong act
of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole world—by
Pandora’s lifting the lid of that miserable
box, and by the fault of Epimetheus, too, in not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
preventing her, these Troubles have obtained a
foothold among us, and do not seem very likely to
be driven away in a hurry. For it was impossible,
as you will easily guess, that the two children should
keep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage. On
the contrary, the first thing that they did was to
fling open the doors and windows, in hopes of getting
rid of them; and, sure enough, away flew the
winged Troubles all abroad, and so pestered and
tormented the small people, everywhere about, that
none of them so much as smiled for many days
afterwards. And, what was very singular, all the
flowers and dewy blossoms on earth, not one of
which had hitherto faded, now began to droop and
shed their leaves, after a day or two. The children,
moreover, who before seemed immortal in the childhood,
now grew older, day by day, and came soon
to be youths and maidens, and men and women by
and by, and aged people, before they dreamed of
such a thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the naughty Pandora, and hardly
less naughty Epimetheus, remained in their cottage.
Both of them had been grievously stung, and were
in a good deal of pain, which seemed the more intolerable
to them, because it was the very first pain
that had ever been felt since the world began. Of
course, they were entirely unaccustomed to it, and
could have no idea what it meant. Besides all this,
they were in exceedingly bad humor, both with
themselves and with one another. In order to indulge
it to the utmost, Epimetheus sat down sullenly
in a corner with his back towards Pandora;
while Pandora flung herself upon the floor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
rested her head on the fatal and abominable box.
She was crying bitterly, and sobbing as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the
inside of the lid.</p>

<p>“What can that be?” cried Pandora, lifting her
head.</p>

<p>But either Epimetheus had not heard the tap,
or was too much out of humor to notice it. At
any rate, he made no answer.</p>

<p>“You are very unkind,” said Pandora, sobbing
anew, “not to speak to me!”</p>

<p>Again the tap! It sounded like the tiny knuckles
of a fairy’s hand, knocking lightly and playfully
on the inside of the box.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Pandora, with a little of
her former curiosity. “Who are you, inside of this
naughty box?”</p>

<p>A sweet little voice spoke from within—</p>

<p>“Only lift the lid, and you shall see.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered Pandora, again beginning to
sob, “I have had enough of lifting the lid! You
are inside of the box, naughty creature, and there
you shall stay! There are plenty of your ugly
brothers and sisters already flying about the world.
You need never think that I shall be so foolish as to
let you out!”</p>

<p>She looked towards Epimetheus, as she spoke,
perhaps expecting that he would commend her for
her wisdom. But the sullen boy only muttered that
she was wise a little too late.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the sweet little voice again, “you had
much better let me out. I am not like those naughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
creatures that have stings in their tails. They are
no brothers and sisters of mine, as you would see
at once, if you were only to get a glimpse of me.
Come, come, my pretty Pandora! I am sure you
will let me out!”</p>

<p>And, indeed, there was a kind of cheerful
witchery in the tone, that made it almost impossible
to refuse anything which this little voice asked.
Pandora’s heart had insensibly grown lighter, at
every word that came from within the box. Epimetheus,
too, though still in the corner, had turned half
round, and seemed to be in rather better spirits
than before.</p>

<p>“My dear Epimetheus,” cried Pandora, “have
you heard this little voice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure I have,” answered he, but in
no very good humor as yet. “And what of it?”</p>

<p>“Shall I lift the lid again?” asked Pandora.</p>

<p>“Just as you please,” said Epimetheus. “You
have done so much mischief already, that perhaps
you may as well do a little more. One other
Trouble, in such a swarm as you have set
adrift about the world, can make no very great
difference.”</p>

<p>“You might speak a little more kindly!” murmured
Pandora, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, naughty boy!” cried the little voice within
the box, in an arch and laughing tone. “He knows
he is longing to see me. Come, my dear Pandora,
lift up the lid. I am in a great hurry to comfort
you. Only let me have some fresh air, and you
shall soon see that matters are not quite so dismal
as you think them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“Epimetheus,” exclaimed Pandora, “come what
may, I am resolved to open the box!”</p>

<p>“And, as the lid seems very heavy,” cried Epimetheus,
running across the room, “I will help you!”</p>

<p>So, with one consent, the two children again
lifted the lid. Out flew a sunny and smiling little
personage, and hovered about the room, throwing
a light wherever she went. Have you never made
the sunshine dance into dark corners, by reflecting
it from a bit of looking-glass? Well, so looked the
winged cheerfulness of this fairy-like stranger,
amid the gloom of the cottage. She flew to Epimetheus,
and laid the least touch of her finger on the
inflamed spot where the Trouble had stung him,
and immediately the anguish of it was gone. Then
she kissed Pandora on the forehead, and her hurt
was cured likewise.</p>

<p>After performing these good offices, the bright
stranger fluttered sportively over the children’s
heads, and looked so sweetly at them, that they
both began to think it not so very much amiss to
have opened the box, since, otherwise, their cheery
guest must have been kept a prisoner among those
naughty imps with stings in their tails.</p>

<p>“Pray, who are you, beautiful creature?” inquired
Pandora.</p>

<p>“I am to be called Hope!” answered the sunshiny
figure. “And because I am such a cheery
little body, I was packed into the box, to make
amends to the human race for that swarm of ugly
Troubles, which was destined to be let loose among
them. Never fear! we shall do pretty well in spite
of them all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your wings are colored like the rainbow!”
exclaimed Pandora. “How very beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are like the rainbow,” said Hope,
“because, glad as my nature is, I am partly made
of tears as well as smiles.”</p>

<p>“And will you stay with us,” asked Epimetheus,
“forever and ever?”</p>

<p>“As long as you need me,” said Hope, with her
pleasant smile—“and that will be as long as you
live in the world—I promise never to desert you.
There may come times and seasons, now and then,
when you will think that I have utterly vanished.
But again, and again, and again, when perhaps
you least dream of it, you shall see the glimmer of
my wings on the ceiling of your cottage. Yes, my
dear children, and I know something very good
and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter!”</p>

<p>“Oh tell us,” they exclaimed—“tell us what
it is!”</p>

<p>“Do not ask me,” replied Hope, putting her
finger on her rosy mouth. “But do not despair,
even if it should never happen while you live on
this earth. Trust in my promise, for it is true.”</p>

<p>“We do trust you!” cried Epimetheus and Pandora,
both in one breath.</p>

<p>And so they did; and not only they, but so has
everybody trusted Hope, that has since been alive.
And to tell you the truth, I cannot help being glad—(though,
to be sure, it was an uncommonly
naughty thing for her to do)—but I cannot help
being glad that our foolish Pandora peeped into
the box. No doubt—no doubt—the Troubles
are still flying about the world, and have increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
in multitude, rather than lessened, and are a very
ugly set of imps, and carry most venomous stings
in their tails. I have felt them already, and expect
to feel them more, as I grow older. But then that
lovely and lightsome little figure of Hope! What
in the world could we do without her? Hope
spiritualizes the earth; Hope makes it always new;
and, even in the earth’s best and brightest aspect,
Hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite
bliss hereafter!</p>

<h2 id="RIP_VAN_WINKLE">RIP VAN WINKLE</h2>

<p class="author">By Washington Irving</p>

<p class="dropcap">Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson
must remember the Kaatskill mountains.
They are a dismembered branch of the
great Appalachian family, and are seen away to the
west of the river, swelling up to a noble height,
and lording it over the surrounding country.
Every change of season, every change of weather,
indeed, every hour of the day, produces some
change in the magical hues and shapes of these
mountains, and they are regarded by all the good
wives, far and near, as perfect barometers. When
the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed
in blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on
the clear evening sky; but, sometimes, when the
rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will gather
a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which,
in the last rays of the setting sun, will glow and
light up like a crown of glory.</p>

<p>At the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager
may have descried the light smoke curling up from
a village, whose shingle-roofs gleam among the
trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt
away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape.
It is a little village of great antiquity, having been
founded by some of the Dutch colonists, in the early
times of the province, just about the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
of the government of the good Peter Stuyvesant
(may he rest in peace!), and there were some of
the houses of the original settlers standing within
a few years, built of small yellow bricks brought
from Holland, having latticed windows and gable
fronts, surmounted with weather-cocks.</p>

<p>In that same village, and in one of these very
houses (which, to tell the precise truth, was sadly
time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived many
years since, while the country was yet a province
of Great Britain, a simple good-natured fellow of
the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a descendant
of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly
in the chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and
accompanied him to the siege of Fort Christina.
He inherited, however, but little of the martial
character of his ancestors. I have observed that
he was a simple, good-natured man; he was, moreover,
a kind neighbor, and an obedient, hen-pecked
husband. Indeed, to the latter circumstance might
be owing that meekness of spirit which gained him
such universal popularity; for those men are most
apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad, who
are under the discipline of shrews at home. Their
tempers, doubtless, are rendered pliant and malleable
in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation;
and a curtain lecture is worth all the sermons in
the world for teaching the virtues of patience and
long-suffering. A termagant wife may, therefore,
in some respects, be considered a tolerable blessing;
and if so, Rip Van Winkle was thrice
blessed.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that he was a great favorite among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
all the good wives of the village, who, as usual,
with the amiable sex, took his part in all family
squabbles; and never failed, whenever they talked
those matters over in their evening gossipings, to
lay all the blame on Dame Van Winkle. The
children of the village, too, would shout with joy
whenever he approached. He assisted at their
sports, made their playthings, taught them to fly
kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories
of ghosts, witches, and Indians. Whenever he
went dodging about the village, he was surrounded
by a troop of them, hanging on his skirts, clambering
on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on
him with impunity; and not a dog would bark at
him throughout the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The great error in Rip’s composition was an
insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor.
It could not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance;
for he would sit on a wet rock, with a
rod as long and heavy as a Tartar’s lance, and fish
all day without a murmur, even though he should
not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would
carry a fowling-piece on his shoulder for hours
together, trudging through woods and swamps,
and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels
or wild pigeons. He would never refuse to assist
a neighbor even in the roughest toil, and was a
foremost man at all country frolics for husking
Indian corn, or building stone fences; the women
of the village, too, used to employ him to run
their errands, and to do such little odd jobs as their
less obliging husbands would not do for them. In
a word Rip was ready to attend to anybody’s business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
but his own; but as to doing family duty, and
keeping his farm in order, he found it impossible.</p>

<p>In fact, he declared it was of no use to work on
his farm, it was the most pestilent little piece of
ground in the whole country; everything about it
went wrong, and would go wrong, in spite of him.
His fences were continually falling to pieces; his
cow would either go astray, or get among the cabbages;
weeds were sure to grow quicker in his
fields than anywhere else; the rain always made a
point of setting in just as he had some out-door
work to do; so that though his patrimonial estate
had dwindled away under his management, acre
by acre, until there was little more left than a mere
patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet it was the
worst conditioned farm in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if
they belonged to nobody. His son Rip, an urchin
begotten in his own likeness, promised to inherit
the habits, with the old clothes of his father. He
was generally seen trooping like a colt at his
mother’s heels, equipped in a pair of his father’s
cast-off galligaskins, which he had much ado to
hold up with one hand, as a fine lady does her train
in bad weather.</p>

<p>Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of those
happy mortals, of foolish, well-oiled dispositions,
who take the world easy, eat white bread or brown,
whichever can be got with least thought or trouble,
and would rather starve on a penny than work for
a pound. If left to himself, he would have whistled
life away in perfect contentment; but his wife kept
continually dinning in his ears about his idleness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
his carelessness, and the ruin he was bringing on
his family. Morning, noon, and night, her tongue
was incessantly going, and everything he said or
did was sure to produce a torrent of household
eloquence. Rip had but one way of replying to
all lectures of the kind, and that, by frequent use,
had grown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders,
shook his head, cast up his eyes, but said nothing.
This, however, always provoked a fresh volley from
his wife; so that he was fain to draw off his forces,
and take to the outside of the house—the only side
which, in truth, belongs to a hen-pecked husband.</p>

<p>Rip’s sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf,
who was as much hen-pecked as his master; for
Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions
in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an
evil eye, as the cause of his master’s going so often
astray. True it is, in all points of spirit befitting
an honorable dog, he was as courageous an animal
as ever scoured the woods—but what courage can
withstand the ever-during and all-besetting terrors
of a woman’s tongue? The moment Wolf entered
the house his crest fell, his tail drooped to the
ground, or curled between his legs, he sneaked
about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong
glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least
flourish of a broomstick or ladle, he would fly to
the door with yelping precipitation.</p>

<p>Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van
Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart
temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue
is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant
use. For a long while he used to console<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
himself, when driven from home, by frequenting
a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers,
and other idle personages of the village, which
held its sessions on a bench before a small inn,
designated by a rubicund portrait of his Majesty
George the Third. Here they used to sit in the
shade through a long lazy summer’s day, talking
listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless
sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have
been worth any statesman’s money to have heard
the profound discussions that sometimes took place,
when by chance an old newspaper fell into their
hands from some passing traveller. How solemnly
they would listen to the contents, as drawled out
by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a
dapper, learned little man, who was not to be
daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary;
and how sagely they would deliberate upon
the public events some months after they had taken
place.</p>

<p>The opinions of this junto were completely controlled
by Nicholas Vedder, a patriarch of the
village, and landlord of the inn, at the door of
which he took his seat from morning till night,
just moving sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep
in the shade of a large tree; so that the neighbors
could tell the hour by his movements as accurately
as by a sun-dial. It is true he was rarely heard
to speak, but smoked his pipe incessantly. His
adherents, however (for every great man has his
adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew
how to gather his opinions. When anything that
was read or related displeased him, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
observed to smoke his pipe vehemently, and to
send forth short, frequent and angry puffs; but
when pleased, he would inhale the smoke slowly
and tranquilly, and emit it in light and placid
clouds; and sometimes, taking the pipe from his
mouth, and letting the fragrant vapor curl about
his nose, would gravely nod his head in token of
perfect approbation.</p>

<p>From even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was
at length routed by his termagant wife, who would
suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of the
assemblage and call the members all to naught;
nor was that august personage, Nicholas Vedder
himself, sacred from the daring tongue of this
terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging
her husband in habits of idleness.</p>

<p>Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair;
and his only alternative, to escape from the labor
of the farm and clamor of his wife, was to take
gun in hand and stroll away into the woods. Here
he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of
a tree, and share the contents of his wallet with
Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow-sufferer
in persecution. “Poor Wolf,” he would say,
“thy mistress leads thee a dog’s life of it; but never
mind, my lad, whilst I live thou shalt never want
a friend to stand by thee!” Wolf would wag his
tail, look wistfully in his master’s face, and if dogs
can feel pity I verily believe he reciprocated the
sentiment with all his heart.</p>

</div>

<p>In a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal
day, Rip had unconsciously scrambled to one of the
highest parts of the Kaatskill mountains. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
after his favorite sport of squirrel shooting, and the
still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the
reports of his gun. Panting and fatigued he threw
himself, late in the afternoon, on a green knoll,
covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the
brow of a precipice. From an opening between the
trees he could overlook all the lower country for
many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance
the lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving
on its silent but majestic course, with the reflection
of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging
bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom,
and at last losing itself in the blue highlands.</p>

<p>On the other side he looked down into a deep
mountain glen, wild, lonely, and shagged, the bottom
filled with fragments from the impending
cliffs, and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of
the setting sun. For some time Rip lay musing on
this scene; evening was gradually advancing; the
mountains began to throw their long blue shadows
over the valleys; he saw that it would be dark long
before he could reach the village, and he heaved
a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the
terrors of Dame Van Winkle.</p>

<p>As he was about to descend, he heard a voice
from a distance, hallooing, “Rip Van Winkle! Rip
Van Winkle!” He looked round, but could see
nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across
the mountain. He thought his fancy must have
deceived him, and turned again to descend, when
he heard the same cry ring through the still evening
air: “Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!”—at
the same time Wolf bristled up his back, and giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
a low growl, skulked to his master’s side, looking
fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a
vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked
anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a
strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks, and
bending under the weight of something he carried
on his back. He was surprised to see any human
being in this lonely and unfrequented place, but
supposing it to be some one of the neighborhood
in need of his assistance, he hastened down to
yield it.</p>

<p>On nearer approach he was still more surprised
at the singularity of the stranger’s appearance. He
was a short square-built old fellow, with thick
bushy hair, and a grizzled beard. His dress was of
the antique Dutch fashion—a cloth jerkin strapped
round the waist—several pair of breeches, the
outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of
buttons down the sides, and bunches at the knees.
He bore on his shoulder a stout keg, that seemed
full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach
and assist him with the load. Though rather shy
and distrustful of this new acquaintance, Rip complied
with his usual alacrity; and mutually relieving
one another, they clambered up a narrow gully,
apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As
they ascended, Rip every now and then heard long
rolling peals, like distant thunder, that seemed to
issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft, between
lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted.
He paused for an instant, but supposing
it to be the muttering of one of those transient
thunder-showers which often take place in mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
heights, he proceeded. Passing through the ravine,
they came to a hollow, like a small amphitheatre,
surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the
brinks of which impending trees shot their branches,
so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky
and the bright evening cloud. During the whole
time Rip and his companion had labored on in
silence; for though the former marvelled greatly
what could be the object of carrying a keg of liquor
up this wild mountain, yet there was something
strange and incomprehensible about the unknown,
that inspired awe and checked familiarity.</p>

<p>On entering the amphitheatre, new objects of
wonder presented themselves. On a level spot in
the center was a company of odd-looking personages
playing at ninepins. They were dressed in a
quaint outlandish fashion; some wore short doublets,
others jerkins, with long knives in their belts,
and most of them had enormous breeches, of similar
style with that of the guide’s. Their visages,
too, were peculiar: one had a large beard, broad
face, and small piggish eyes; the face of another
seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted
by a white sugar-loaf hat set off with a
little red cock’s tail. They all had beards, of various
shapes and colors. There was one who seemed
to be the commander. He was a stout old gentleman,
with a weather-beaten countenance; he wore
a laced doublet, broad belt and hanger, high-crowned
hat and feather, red stockings, and high-heeled
shoes, with roses in them. The whole group
reminded Rio of the figures in an old Flemish
painting, in the parlor of Dominie Van Shaick, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
village parson, and which had been brought over
from Holland at the time of the settlement.</p>

<p>What seemed particularly odd to Rip was, that
though these folks were evidently amusing themselves,
yet they maintained the gravest faces, the
most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most
melancholy party of pleasure he had ever witnessed.
Nothing interrupted the stillness of the
scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever
they were rolled, echoed along the mountains like
rumbling peals of thunder.</p>

<p>As Rip and his companion approached them,
they suddenly desisted from their play, and stared
at him with such fixed statue-like gaze, and such
strange, uncouth, lack-luster countenances, that his
heart turned within him, and his knees smote
together. His companion now emptied the contents
of the keg into large flagons, and made signs to
him to wait upon the company. He obeyed with
fear and trembling; they quaffed the liquor in
profound silence, and then returned to their
game.</p>

<p>By degrees Rip’s awe and apprehension subsided.
He even ventured, when no eye was fixed
upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had
much of the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was
naturally a thirsty soul, and was soon tempted to
repeat the draught. One taste provoked another;
and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often
that at length his senses were overpowered, his
eyes swam in his head, his head gradually declined,
and he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>On waking, he found himself on the green knoll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
whence he had first seen the old man of the glen.
He rubbed his eyes—it was a bright sunny morning.
The birds were hopping and twittering among
the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft, and
breasting the pure mountain breeze. “Surely,”
thought Rip, “I have not slept here all night.” He
recalled the occurrences before he fell asleep. The
strange man with a keg of liquor—the mountain
ravine—the wild retreat among the rocks—the woebegone
party at ninepins—the flagon—“Oh! that
flagon! that wicked flagon!” thought Rip—“what
excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle!”</p>

<p>He looked round for his gun, but in place of the
clean well-oiled fowling-piece, he found an old firelock
lying by him, the barrel incrusted with rust,
the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten. He
now suspected that the grave roysters of the mountain
had put a trick upon him, and, having dosed
him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun. Wolf,
too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed
away after a squirrel or partridge. He whistled
after him and shouted his name, but all in vain;
the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no
dog was to be seen.</p>

<p>He determined to revisit the scene of the last
evening’s gambol, and if he met with any of the
party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to
walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting
in his usual activity. “These mountain beds
do not agree with me,” thought Rip, “and if this
frolic should lay me up with a fit of rheumatism,
I shall have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.”
With some difficulty he got down into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
glen: he found the gully up which he and his companion
had ascended the preceding evening; but to
his astonishment a mountain stream was now foaming
down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling
the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however,
made shift to scramble up its sides, working his
toilsome way through thickets of birch, sassafras,
and witch-hazel, and sometimes tripped up or
entangled by the wild grapevines that twisted their
coils or tendrils from tree to tree, and spread a kind
of network in his path.</p>

<p>At length he reached to where the ravine had
opened through the cliffs to the amphitheatre; but
no traces of such opening remained. The rocks
presented a high impenetrable wall, over which the
torrent came tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam,
and fell into a broad deep basin, black from the
shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then,
poor Rip was brought to a stand. He again called
and whistled after his dog; he was only answered
by the cawing of a flock of idle crows, sporting high
in air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice;
and who, secure in their elevation, seemed to
look down and scoff at the poor man’s perplexities.
What was to be done? The morning was passing
away, and Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast.
He grieved to give up his dog and gun; he
dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to
starve among the mountains. He shook his head,
shouldered the rusty firelock, and, with a heart
full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps homeward.</p>

<p>As he approached the village he met a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of people, but none whom he knew, which somewhat
surprised him, for he had thought himself
acquainted with every one in the country round.
Their dress, too, was of a different fashion from
that to which he was accustomed. They all stared
at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever
they cast their eyes upon him, invariably stroked
their chins. The constant recurrence of this gesture
induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same,
when, to his astonishment, he found his beard had
grown a foot long!</p>

<p>He had now entered the skirts of the village. A
troop of strange children ran at his heels, hooting
after him, and pointing at his gray beard. The
dogs, too, not one of which he recognized for an
old acquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The
very village was altered; it was larger and more
populous. There were rows of houses which he
had never seen before, and those which had been
his familiar haunts had disappeared. Strange
names were over the doors—strange faces at the
windows—everything was strange. His mind now
misgave him; he began to doubt whether both he
and the world around him were not bewitched.
Surely this was his native village, which he had left
but the day before. There stood the Kaatskill
mountains—there ran the silver Hudson at a distance—there
was every hill and dale precisely as
it had always been. Rip was sorely perplexed—“That
flagon last night,” thought he, “has addled
my poor head sadly!”</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that he found the way
to his own house, which he approached with silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
awe, expecting every moment to hear the shrill
voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house
gone to decay—the roof fallen in, the windows
shattered, and the doors off the hinges. A half-starved
dog that looked like Wolf was skulking
about it. Rip called him by name, but the cur
snarled, showed his teeth, and passed on. This
was an unkind cut indeed—“My very dog,” sighed
poor Rip, “has forgotten me!”</p>

<p>He entered the house, which, to tell the truth,
Dame Van Winkle had always kept in neat order.
It was empty, forlorn, and apparently abandoned.
This desolateness overcame all his connubial fears—he
called loudly for his wife and children—the
lonely chambers rang for a moment with his voice,
and then all again was silence.</p>

<p>He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old
resort, the village inn—but it too was gone. A
large rickety wooden building stood in its place,
with great gaping windows, some of them broken
and mended with old hats and petticoats, and over
the door was painted, “the Union Hotel, by Jonathan
Doolittle.” Instead of the great tree that
used to shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore,
there now was reared a tall naked pole, with something
on the top that looked like a red night-cap,
and from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a
singular assemblage of stars and stripes—all this
was strange and incomprehensible. He recognized
on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George,
under which he had smoked so many a peaceful
pipe; but even this was singularly metamorphosed.
The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
a sword was held in the hand instead of a scepter,
the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and
underneath was painted in large characters, <span class="smcap">General
Washington</span>.</p>

<p>There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the
door, but none that Rip recollected. The very
character of the people seemed changed. There
was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it,
instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy
tranquillity. He looked in vain for the sage
Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face, double chin,
and fair long pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco-smoke
instead of idle speeches; or Van Bummel,
the schoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an
ancient newspaper. In place of these, a lean,
bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of
handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights
of citizens—elections—members of Congress—liberty—Bunker’s
Hill—heroes of seventy-six—and
other words, which were a perfect Babylonish
jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.</p>

<p>The appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled
beard, his rusty fowling-piece, his uncouth dress,
and an army of women and children at his heels,
soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians.
They crowded round him, eyeing him from
head to foot with great curiosity. The orator
bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside,
inquired “on which side he voted?” Rip stared in
vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little
fellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe,
inquired in his ear, “whether he was Federal or
Democrat?” Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the question; when a knowing, self-important
old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way
through the crowd, putting them to the right and
left with his elbows as he passed, and planting himself
before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the
other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp
hat penetrating, as it were, into his very soul, demanded
in an austere tone, “what brought him to
the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob
at his heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in
the village?”—“Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat
dismayed, “I am a poor quiet man, a native
of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God
bless him!”</p>

<p>Here a general shout burst from the bystanders:
“A tory! a tory! a spy! a refugee! hustle him! away
with him!” It was with great difficulty that the
self-important man in the cocked hat restored
order; and, having assumed a tenfold austerity of
brow, demanded again of the unknown culprit,
what he came there for, and whom he was seeking?
The poor man humbly assured him that he meant
no harm, but merely came there in search of some
of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.</p>

<p>“Well—who are they?—name them.”</p>

<p>Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired,
“Where’s Nicholas Vedder?”</p>

<p>There was a silence for a little while, when an old
man replied in a thin piping voice, “Nicholas Vedder!
why, he is dead and gone these eighteen years!
There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard
that used to tell all about him, but that’s rotten and
gone too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s Brom Dutcher?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of
the war; some say he was killed at the storming of
Stony Point—others say he was drowned in a squall
at the foot of Anthony Nose. I don’t know—he
never came back again.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?”</p>

<p>“He went off to the wars too, was a great militia
general, and is now in Congress.”</p>

<p>Rip’s heart died away at hearing of these sad
changes in his home and friends, and finding himself
thus alone in the world. Every answer puzzled
him too, by treating of such enormous lapses of
time, and of matters which he could not understand:
war—congress—Stony Point—he had no
courage to ask after any more friends, but cried
out in despair, “Does nobody here know Rip Van
Winkle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rip Van Winkle!” exclaimed two or three.
“Oh, to be sure! that’s Rip Van Winkle yonder,
leaning against the tree.”</p>

<p>Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of
himself, as he went up the mountain: apparently as
lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was
now completely confounded. He doubted his own
identity, and whether he was himself or another
man. In the midst of his bewilderment, the man
in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what
was his name?</p>

<p>“God knows,” exclaimed he, at his wits’ end;
“I’m not myself—I’m somebody else—that’s me
yonder—no—that’s somebody else got into my
shoes—I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the mountain, and they’ve changed my gun, and
everything’s changed, and I’m changed and I can’t
tell my name, or who I am!”</p>

<p>The bystanders began now to look at each other,
nod, wink significantly, and tap their fingers
against their foreheads. There was a whisper,
also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old
fellow from doing mischief, at the very suggestion
of which the self-important man in the cocked hat
retired with some precipitation. At this critical
moment a fresh, comely woman pressed through
the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded
man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which,
frightened at his looks, began to cry. “Hush, Rip,”
cried she, “hush, you little fool; the old man won’t
hurt you.” The name of the child, the air of the
mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train
of recollections in his mind. “What’s your name,
my good woman?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Judith Gardenier.”</p>

<p>“And your father’s name?”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name,
but it’s twenty years since he went away from home
with his gun, and never has been heard of since—his
dog came home without him; but whether he
shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians,
nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl.”</p>

<p>Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put
it with a faltering voice:</p>

<p>“Where’s your mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she too had died but a short time since; she
broke a blood-vessel in a fit of passion at a New
England peddler.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this
intelligence. The honest man could contain himself
no longer. He caught his daughter and her child
in his arms. “I am your father!” cried he—“Young
Rip Van Winkle once—old Rip Van Winkle now!—Does
nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?”</p>

<p>All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering
out from among the crowd, put her hand to her
brow, and peering under it in his face for a moment,
exclaimed, “Sure enough; it is Rip Van Winkle—it
is himself! Welcome home again, old neighbor—Why,
where have you been these twenty long
years?”</p>

<p>Rip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty
years had been to him but as one night. The neighbors
stared when they heard it; some were seen to
wink at each other, and put their tongues in their
cheeks; and the self-important man in the cocked
hat, who, when the alarm was over, had returned to
the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth,
and shook his head—upon which there was a general
shaking of the head throughout the assemblage.</p>

<p>It was determined, however, to take the opinion
of old Peter Vanderdonk, who was seen slowly advancing
up the road. He was a descendant of
the historian of that name, who wrote one of the
earliest accounts of the province. Peter was the
most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well
versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of
the neighborhood. He recollected Rip at once and
corroborated his story in the most satisfactory manner.
He assured the company that it was a fact,
handed down from his ancestor the historian, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the Kaatskill mountains had always been haunted
by strange beings. That it was affirmed that the
great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the
river and country, kept a kind of vigil there every
twenty years, with his crew of the <i>Half-Moon</i>;
being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of
his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the
river, and the great city called by his name. That
his father had once seen them in their old Dutch
dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of the
mountain; and that he himself had heard, one summer
afternoon, the sound of their balls like distant
peals of thunder.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, the company broke
up, and returned to the more important concerns
of the election. Rip’s daughter took him home to
live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house,
and a stout cheery farmer for a husband, whom
Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to
climb upon his back. As to Rip’s son and heir, who
was the ditto of himself, seen leaning against the
tree, he was employed to work on the farm; but
evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to anything
else but his business.</p>

<p>Rip now resumed his old walks and habits; he
soon found many of his former cronies, though all
rather the worse for the wear and tear of time, and
preferred making friends among the rising generation,
with whom he soon grew into great favor.</p>

<p>Having nothing to do at home, and being arrived
at that happy age when a man can be idle with
impunity, he took his place once more on the bench
at the inn door, and was reverenced as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
patriarchs of the village, and a chronicle of the old
times “before the war.” It was some time before
he could get into the regular track of gossip, or
could be made to comprehend the strange events
that had taken place during his torpor. How that
there had been a revolutionary war—that the country
had thrown off the yoke of old England—and
that, instead of being a subject of his Majesty
George the Third, he was now a free citizen of the
United States. Rip, in fact, was no politician; the
changes of states and empires made but little impression
on him; but there was one species of
despotism under which he had long groaned, and
that was—petticoat government. Happily that
was at an end; he had got his neck out of the yoke
of matrimony, and could go in and out whenever
he pleased, without dreading the tyranny of Dame
Van Winkle. Whenever her name was mentioned,
however, he shook his head, shrugged his shoulders,
and cast up his eyes; which might pass either for
an expression of resignation to his fate, or joy at
his deliverance.</p>

<p>He used to tell his story to every stranger that
arrived at Mr. Doolittle’s hotel. He was observed,
at first, to vary on some points every time he told
it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so
recently awakened. It at last settled down precisely
to the tale I have related, and not a man,
woman or child in the neighborhood but knew it by
heart. Some always pretended to doubt the reality
of it, and insisted that Rip had been out of his head,
and that this was one point on which he always
remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
however, almost universally gave it full credit.
Even to this day they never hear a thunderstorm
of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but
they say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at
their game of ninepins; and it is a common wish of
all hen-pecked husbands in the neighborhood, when
life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might
have a quieting draught out of Rip Van Winkle’s
flagon.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LEGEND_OF_SLEEPY_HOLLOW">THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW</h2>

<p class="author">By Washington Irving</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the bosom of one of those spacious coves
which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson,
at that broad expansion of the river denominated
by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee,
and where they always prudently shortened sail,
and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when
they crossed, there lies a small market-town or
rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh,
but which is more generally and properly known
by the name of Tarrytown. This name was given,
we are told, in former days, by the good housewives
of the adjacent country, from the inveterate
propensity of their husbands to linger about the
tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do
not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for
the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far
from this village, perhaps about two miles, there
is a little valley, or rather lap of land, among high
hills, which is one of the quietest places in the
whole world. A small brook glides through it, with
just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the
occasional whistle of a quail, or tapping of a woodpecker,
is almost the only sound that ever breaks in
upon the uniform tranquillity.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit
in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees
that shades one side of the valley. I had
wandered into it at noon time, when all nature is
peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar
of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness
around, and was prolonged and reverberated by
the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat,
whither I might steal from the world and
its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant
of a troubled life, I know of none more promising
than this little valley.</p>

<p>From the listless repose of the place, and the
peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants
from the original Dutch settlers, this
sequestered glen has long been known by the name
of <span class="smcap">Sleepy Hollow</span>, and its rustic lads are called
the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the
neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence
seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the
very atmosphere. Some say that the place was
bewitched by a high German doctor, during the
early days of the settlement; others, that an old
Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe,
held his pow-wows there before the country was
discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain
it is, the place still continues under the sway of
some witching power, that holds a spell over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
minds of the good people, causing them to walk in
a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds
of marvellous beliefs; are subject to trances and
visions; and frequently see strange sights, and hear
music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood
abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and
twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors
glare oftener across the valley than in any other
part of the country, and the nightmare, with her
whole nine-fold, seems to make it the favorite scene
of her gambols.</p>

<p>The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this
enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief
of all the powers of the air, is the apparition
of a figure on horseback without a head. It is
said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper,
whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball,
in some nameless battle during the revolutionary
war; and who is ever and anon seen by
the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of
night as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts
are not confined to the valley, but extend at times
to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity
of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain
of the most authentic historians of those parts,
who have been careful in collecting and collating
the floating facts concerning this specter, allege
that the body of the trooper, having been buried
in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the
scene of battle in nightly quest of his head;
and that the rushing speed with which he
sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight
blast, is owing to his being belated, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.</p>

<p>Such is the general purport of this legendary
superstition, which has furnished materials for
many a wild story in that region of shadows; and
the specter is known, at all the country firesides,
by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy
Hollow.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the visionary propensity
I have mentioned is not confined to the native
inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously
imbibed by every one who resides there for a time.
However wide awake they may have been before
they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in
a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the
air, and begin to grow imaginative—to dream
dreams, and see apparitions.</p>

<p>I mention this peaceful spot with all possible
laud; for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys,
found here and there embosomed in the great State
of New York, that population, manners, and customs,
remain fixed; while the great torrent of migration
and improvement, which is making such
incessant changes in other parts of this restless
country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are
like those little nooks of still water which border a
rapid stream; where we may see the straw and
bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving
in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of
the passing current.</p>

<p>Though many years have elapsed since I trod
the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question
whether I should not still find the same trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
and the same families vegetating in its sheltered
bosom.</p>

<p>In this by-place of nature, there abode, in a
remote period of American history, that is to say,
some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the
name of Ichabod Crane; who sojourned, or, as he
expressed it, “tarried,” in Sleepy Hollow, for the
purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity.
He was a native of Connecticut; a State which
supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as
well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its
legions of frontier woodsmen and country schoolmasters.
The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable
to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly
lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs,
hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet
that might have served for shovels, and his whole
frame most loosely hung together. His head was
small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green
glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked
like a weathercock, perched upon his spindle neck,
to tell which way the wind blew. To see him
striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day,
with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him,
one might have mistaken him for the genius of
famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow
eloped from a cornfield.</p>

<p>His school-house was a low building of one large
room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows
partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of
old copy-books. It was most ingeniously secured
at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle
of the door, and stakes set against the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
shutters; so that, though a thief might get in with
perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in
getting out; an idea most probably borrowed by
the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery
of an eel-pot. The school-house stood in a rather
lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a
woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a
formidable birch tree growing at one end of it.
From hence the low murmur of his pupils’ voices,
conning over their lessons, might be heard in a
drowsy summer’s day, like the hum of a bee-hive;
interrupted now and then by the authoritative
voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command;
or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of
the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the
flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was
a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the
golden maxim, “Spare the rod and spoil the child.”—Ichabod
Crane’s scholars certainly were not
spoiled.</p>

<p>I would not have it imagined, however, that he
was one of those cruel potentates of the school,
who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the
contrary, he administered justice with discrimination
rather than severity; taking the burthen off
the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of
the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that
winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed
by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were
satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some
little, tough, wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch
urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged
and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
“doing his duty by their parents”; and he never
inflicted a chastisement without following it by
the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting
urchin, that “he would remember it, and thank
him for it the longest day he had to live.”</p>

<p>When school hours were over, he was even the
companion and playmate of the larger boys; and
on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the
smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty
sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for
the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed, it behooved
him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The
revenue arising from his school was small, and
would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him
with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and
though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda;
but to help out his maintenance, he was,
according to country custom in those parts,
boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers,
whose children he instructed. With these he lived
successively a week at a time; thus going the
rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly
effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>That all this might not be too onerous on the
purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to consider
the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and
schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways
of rendering himself both useful and agreeable.
He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter
labors of their farms; helped to make hay; mended
the fences; took the horses to water; drove the
cows from pasture; and cut wood for the winter
fire. He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his
little empire, the school, and became wonderfully
gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the
eyes of the mothers, by petting the children, particularly
the youngest; and like the lion bold,
which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did
hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and
rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.</p>

<p>In addition to his other vocations, he was the
singing-master of the neighborhood, and picked
up many bright shillings by instructing the young
folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little
vanity to him, on Sundays, to take his station in
front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen
singers; where, in his own mind, he completely
carried away the palm from the parson. Certain
it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of
the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers
still to be heard in that church, and which may be
heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of
the mill-pond, on a still Sunday morning, which
are said to be legitimately descended from the
nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little
makeshifts in that ingenious way which is commonly
denominated “by hook and by crook,” the
worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and
was thought, by all who understood nothing of the
labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life
of it.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster is generally a man of some
importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood;
being considered a kind of idle gentlemanlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments
to the rough country swains, and
indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson.
His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some
little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the
addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or
sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a
silver teapot. Our man of letters, therefore, was
peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country
damsels. How he would figure among them in
the churchyard, between services on Sundays!
gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that
overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their
amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or
sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along
the banks of the adjacent mill-pond; while
the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly
back, envying his superior elegance and
address.</p>

<p>From his half itinerant life, also, he was a kind
of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of
local gossip from house to house; so that his
appearance was always greeted with satisfaction.
He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a
man of great erudition, for he had read several
books quite through, and was a perfect master of
Cotton Mather’s History of New England Witchcraft,
in which, by the way, he most firmly and
potently believed.</p>

<p>He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness
and simple credulity. His appetite for the
marvellous, and his powers of digesting it, were
equally extraordinary; and both had been increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
by his residence in this spellbound region. No
tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious
swallow. It was often his delight, after his
school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch
himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the
little brook that whimpered by his school-house,
and there con over old Mather’s direful tales, until
the gathering dusk of the evening made the printed
page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he
wended his way, by swamp and stream and awful
woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened
to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that
witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination:
the moan of the whip-poor-will<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from the hillside;
the boding cry of the tree-toad, that harbinger of
storm; the dreary hooting of the screech-owl, or
the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened
from their roost. The fireflies, too, which
sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now
and then startled him, as one of uncommon
brightness would stream across his path; and if,
by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came
winging his blundering flight against him, the
poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with
the idea that he was struck with a witch’s token.
His only resource on such occasions, either to
drown thought, or drive away evil spirits, was
to sing psalm tunes;—and the good people of
Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an
evening, were often filled with awe at hearing
his nasal melody, “in linked sweetness long drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
out,” floating from the distant hill, or along the
dusky road.</p>

<p>Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was,
to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch
wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row
of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth,
and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and
goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks,
and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and
particularly of the headless horseman, or galloping
Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called
him. He would delight them equally by his
anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens
and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which
prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and
would frighten them woefully with speculations
upon comets and shooting stars; and with the
alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn
round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!</p>

<p>But if there was a pleasure in all this, while
snugly cuddling in the chimney-corner of a chamber
that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling
wood fire, and where, of course, no specter dared
to show his face, it was dearly purchased by the
terrors of his subsequent walk homewards. What
fearful shapes and shadows beset his path amidst
the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night!—With
what wistful look did he eye every trembling
ray of light streaming across the waste fields from
some distant window!—How often was he appalled
by some shrub covered with snow, which, like a
sheeted specter, beset his very path!—How often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of
his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet;
and dreaded to look over his shoulder, lest he
should behold some uncouth being tramping close
behind him!—and how often was he thrown into
complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling
among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping
Hessian on one of his nightly scourings!</p>

<p>All these, however, were mere terrors of the
night, phantoms of the mind that walked in darkness;
and though he had seen many specters in his
time, and been more than once beset by Satan in
divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet
daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would
have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the
devil and all his works, if his path had not been
crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to
mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole
race of witches put together, and that was—a
woman.</p>

<p>Among the musical disciples who assembled, one
evening in each week, to receive his instructions in
psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter
and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She
was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a
partridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as
one of her father’s peaches, and universally famed,
not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations.
She was withal a little of a coquette, as
might be perceived even in her dress, which was a
mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most
suited to set off her charms. She wore the ornaments
of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
had brought over from Saardam; the
tempting stomacher of the olden time; and withal
a provokingly short petticoat, to display the
prettiest foot and ankle in the country road.</p>

<p>Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards
the sex; and it is not to be wondered at that
so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes;
more especially after he had visited her in her
paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a
perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted
farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either
his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of
his own farm; but within those everything was
snug, happy, and well-conditioned. He was satisfied
with his wealth, but not proud of it; and
piqued himself upon the hearty abundance rather
than the style in which he lived. His stronghold
was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one
of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks, in which
Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great
elm-tree spread its broad branches over it; at the
foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and
sweetest water, in a little well, formed of a barrel;
and then stole sparkling away through the grass,
to a neighboring brook, that bubbled along among
alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse
was a vast barn, that might have served for a
church; every window and crevice of which seemed
bursting forth with the treasures of the farm. The
flail was busily resounding within it from morning
to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering
about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with
one eye turned up, as if watching the weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
some with their heads under their wings, or buried
in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing,
and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the
sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers
were grunting in the repose and abundance of their
pens; whence sallied forth, now and then, troops
of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately
squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining
pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments
of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard,
and guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered
housewives, with their peevish, discontented
cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant
cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior, and
a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings, and
crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart—sometimes
tearing up the earth with his feet, and
then generously calling his ever-hungry family of
wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which
he had discovered.</p>

<p>The pedagogue’s mouth watered, as he looked
upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter
fare. In his devouring mind’s eye, he pictured to
himself every roasting-pig running about with a
pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth;
the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable
pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the
geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the
ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married
couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce.
In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek
side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey
but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of
savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself
lay sprawling on his back, in a side-dish, with
uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his
chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.</p>

<p>As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and
as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat
meadow-lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of
buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards
burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded
the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart
yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these
domains, and his imagination expanded with the
idea, how they might be readily turned into cash,
and the money invested in immense tracts of wild
land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay,
his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and
presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a
whole family of children, mounted on the top of a
wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots
and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself
bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her
heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee, or the
Lord knows where.</p>

<p>When he entered the house the conquest of his
heart was complete. It was one of those spacious
farmhouses, with high-ridged, but lowly-sloping
roofs, built in the style handed down from the
first Dutch settlers, the low projecting eaves
forming a piazza along the front, capable of being
closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung
flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and
nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
were built along the sides for summer use; and a
great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at
the other, showed the various uses to which this
important porch might be devoted. From this
piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall,
which formed the center of the mansion and the
place of usual residence. Here, rows of resplendent
pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his
eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool
ready to be spun; in another a quantity of linsey-woolsey
just from the loom; ears of Indian corn,
and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in
gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the
gaud of red peppers, and a door left ajar gave
him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed
chairs, and dark mahogany tables, shone
like mirrors. Andirons, with their accompanying
shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of
asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells
decorated the mantel-piece; strings of various
colored birds’ eggs were suspended above it. A
great ostrich egg was hung from the center of the
room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open,
displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended
china.</p>

<p>From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon
these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was
at an end, and his only study was how to gain the
affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel.
In this enterprise, however, he had more real
difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a
knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything
but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with;
and had to make his way merely through gates
of iron and brass, and walls of adamant, to the
castle keep, where the lady of his heart was
confined, all of which he achieved as easily as a
man would carve his way to the center of a
Christmas pie, and then the lady gave him her
hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary,
had to win his way to the heart of a country
coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and
caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties
and impediments; and he had to encounter
a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood,
the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every
portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry
eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common
cause against any new competitor.</p>

<p>Among these the most formidable was a burly,
roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham,
or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom
Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which
rang with his feats of strength and hardihood.
He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with
short curly black hair, and a bluff, but not unpleasant
countenance, having a mingled air of fun and
arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great
powers of limb, he had received the nickname of
<span class="smcap">Brom Bones</span>, by which he was universally known.
He was famed for great knowledge and skill in
horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as
a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock-fights;
and, with the ascendency which bodily
strength acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving
his decisions with an air and tone admitting of no
gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either
a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will
in his composition; and, with all his overbearing
roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish
good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon
companions, who regarded him as their model, and
at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending
every scene of feud or merriment for miles
round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a
fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox’s tail;
and when the folks at a country gathering descried
this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about
among a squad of hard riders, they always stood
by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be
heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight,
with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don
Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their
sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry
had clattered by, and then exclaim, “Ay,
there goes Brom Bones and his gang!” The
neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe,
admiration, and good will; and when any madcap
prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always
shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones
was at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>This rantipole hero had for some time singled
out the blooming Katrina for the object of his
uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous
toyings were something like the gentle caresses and
endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that
she did not altogether discourage his hopes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival
candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to
cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his
horse was seen tied to Van Tassel’s paling, on a
Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was
courting, or, as it is termed, “sparking,” within,
all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried
the war into other quarters.</p>

<p>Such was the formidable rival with whom
Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering
all things, a stouter man than he would have
shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man
would have despaired. He had, however, a happy
mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature;
he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack—yielding,
but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and
though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet,
the moment it was away—jerk! he was as erect,
and carried his head as high as ever.</p>

<p>To have taken the field openly against his rival
would have been madness; for he was not a man
to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that
stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made
his advances in a quiet and gently-insinuating
manner. Under cover of his character of singing-master,
he made frequent visits at the farmhouse;
not that he had anything to apprehend from the
meddlesome interference of parents, which is so
often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers.
Balt Van Tassel was an easy, indulgent soul; he
loved his daughter better even than his pipe,
and like a reasonable man and an excellent father,
let her have her way in everything. His notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her
housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she
sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things,
and must be looked after, but girls can take care
of themselves. Thus while the busy dame bustled
about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one
end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking
his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements
of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a
sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the
wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the meantime,
Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter
by the side of the spring under the great elm, or
sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so
favorable to the lover’s eloquence.</p>

<p>I profess not to know how women’s hearts are
wooed and won. To me they have always been
matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to
have but one vulnerable point, or door of access;
while others have a thousand avenues, and may be
captured in a thousand different ways. It is a
great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still
greater proof of generalship to maintain possession
of the latter, for the man must battle for his fortress
at every door and window. He who wins a
thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to
some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway
over the heart of a coquette, is indeed a hero.
Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable
Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod
Crane made his advances, the interests of the
former evidently declined; his horse was no longer
seen tied at the palings on Sunday nights, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
deadly feud gradually arose between him and the
preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<p>Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his
nature, would fain have carried matters to open
warfare, and have settled their pretensions to the
lady, according to the mode of those most concise
and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore—by
single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious
of the superior might of his adversary to enter the
lists against him: he had overheard a boast of
Bones, that he would “double the schoolmaster up,
and lay him on a shelf of his own school-house”;
and he was too wary to give him an opportunity.
There was something extremely provoking in this
obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative
but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery
in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical
jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object
of whimsical persecution to Bones, and his gang
of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful
domains; smoked out his singing-school, by
stopping up the chimney; broke into the school-house
at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings
of withe and window stakes, and turned everything
topsy-turvy: so that the poor schoolmaster
began to think all the witches in the country held
their meetings there. But what was still more
annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning
him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and
had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in
the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a
rival of Ichabod’s to instruct her in psalmody.</p>

<p>In this way matters went on for some time, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
producing any material effect on the relative
situation of the contending powers. On a fine
autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat
enthroned on the lofty stool whence he usually
watched all the concerns of his little literary realm.
In his hand he swayed a ferule, that scepter of
despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on
three nails, behind the throne, a constant terror to
evil doers; while on the desk before him might be
seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited
weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins;
such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs,
fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper
game-cocks. Apparently there had been some
appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his
scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or
slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept
upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness
reigned throughout the school-room. It was suddenly
interrupted by the appearance of a negro,
in tow-doth jacket and trousers, a round-crowned
fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and
mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken
colt, which he managed with a rope by way of
halter. He came clattering up to the school door
with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making
or “quilting frolic,” to be held that evening
at Mynheer Van Tassel’s; and having delivered
his message with that air of importance, and effort
at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on
petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the
brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow,
full of the importance and hurry of his mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet
school-room. The scholars were hurried through
their lessons, without stopping at trifles; those
who were nimble skipped over half with impunity,
and those who were tardy, had a smart application
now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed,
or help them over a tall word. Books were flung
aside without being put away on the shelves, ink-stands
were overturned, benches thrown down, and
the whole school was turned loose an hour before
the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young
imps, yelping, and racketing about the green, in joy
at their early emancipation.</p>

<p>The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra
half-hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up
his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and
arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass,
that hung up in the school-house. That he
might make his appearance before his mistress in
the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse
from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a
choleric old Dutchman, of the name of Hans Van
Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth,
like a knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it
is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic
story, give some account of the looks and equipments
of my hero and his steed. The animal he
bestrode was a broken-down plough-horse, that
had outlived almost everything but his viciousness.
He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck and a
head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were
tangled and knotted with burrs; one eye had lost
its pupil, and was glaring and spectral; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still
he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we
may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder.
He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master’s,
the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious
rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his
own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down
as he looked, there was more of the lurking
devil in him than in any young filly in the country.</p>

<p>Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed.
He rode with short stirrups, which brought his
knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his
sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers’; he
carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a
scepter, and, as his horse jogged on, the motion of
his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of
wings. A small wool hat rested on the top of his
nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be
called; and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out
almost to the horse’s tail. Such was the appearance
of Ichabod and his steed, as they shambled out of
the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether
such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in
broad daylight.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day, the
sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich
and golden livery which we always associate with
the idea of abundance. The forests had put on
their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of
the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts
into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet.
Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their
appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
might be heard from the groves of beech and
hickory nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail
at intervals from the neighboring stubble-field.</p>

<p>The small birds were taking their farewell
banquets. In the fulness of their revelry, they
fluttered, chirping and frolicking, from bush to
bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very
profusion and variety around them. There was
the honest cock-robin, the favorite game of stripling
sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and
the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds;
and the golden-winged woodpecker, with his crimson
crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid
plumage; and the cedar-bird, with its red-tipped
wings and yellow-tipped tail, and its little montero
cap of feathers; and the bluejay; that noisy coxcomb,
in his gay light-blue coat and white under-clothes;
screaming and chattering, nodding and
bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good
terms with every songster of the grove.</p>

<p>As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye,
ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance,
ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly
autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of
apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on
the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels
for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for
the cider-press. Farther on he beheld great fields
of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from
their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of
cakes and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins
lying beneath them, turning up their fair round
bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed
the fragrant buckwheat fields, breathing the odor
of the bee-hive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations
stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks,
well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle,
by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van
Tassel.</p>

<p>Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts
and “sugared suppositions,” he journeyed along
the sides of a range of hills which look out upon
some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson.
The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down
into the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan
Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here
and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged
the blue shadow of the distant mountain.
A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a
breath of air to move them. The horizon was of
a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure
apple green, and from that into the deep blue of
the mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the
woody crests of the precipices that overhung some
parts of the river, giving greater depth to the
dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop
was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down
with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against
the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed
along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was
suspended in the air.</p>

<p>It was towards evening that Ichabod arrived
at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he
found thronged with the pride and flower of the
adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue
stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter
buckles. Their brisk withered little dames, in
close-crimped caps, long-waisted short gowns,
homespun petticoats, with scissors and pin-cushions,
and gay calico pockets hanging on the
outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as
their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine
ribbon, or perhaps a white frock gave symptoms
of city innovation. The sons, in short square-skirted
coats with rows of stupendous brass
buttons, and their hair generally queued in the
fashion of the times, especially if they could procure
an eel-skin for the purpose, it being esteemed,
throughout the country, as a potent nourisher and
strengthener of the hair.</p>

<p>Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene,
having come to the gathering on his favorite steed
Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle
and mischief, and which no one but himself could
manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring
vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks, which
kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he
held a tractable well-broken horse as unworthy of
a lad of spirit.</p>

<p>Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of
charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of
my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van
Tassel’s mansion. Not those of the bevy of
buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red
and white; but the ample charms of a genuine
Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time
of autumn. Such heaped-up platters of cakes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
various and almost indescribable kinds, known
only to experienced Dutch housewives! There
was the doughty doughnut, the tenderer oly-koek,
and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes
and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and
the whole family of cakes. And then there
were apple pies and peach pies and pumpkin
pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and
moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums,
and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention
broiled shad and roasted chickens; together
with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy,
pretty much as I have enumerated
them, with the motherly teapot sending up its
clouds of vapor from the midst—Heaven bless
the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this
banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get
on with my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was
not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did
ample justice to every dainty.</p>

<p>He was a kind and thankful creature, whose
heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled
with good cheer; and whose spirits rose with
eating as some men’s do with drink. He could not
help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he
ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he
might one day be lord of all this scene of almost
unimaginable luxury and splendor. Then, he
thought, how soon he’d turn his back upon the
old school-house, snap his fingers in the face of
Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly
patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of
doors that should dare to call him comrade!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his
guests with a face dilated with content and good
humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His
hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive,
being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on
the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation
to “fall to, and help themselves.”</p>

<p>And now the sound of the music from the common
room, or hall, summoned to the dance. The
musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had
been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood
for more than half a century. His instrument was
as old and battered as himself. The greater part
of the time he scraped on two or three strings,
accompanying every movement of the bow with a
motion of the head, bowing almost to the ground,
and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple
were to start.</p>

<p>Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as
much as upon his vocal powers. Not a limb, not
a fiber about him was idle; and to have seen his
loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering
about the room, you would have thought Saint
Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance,
was figuring before you in person. He was the
admiration of all the negroes; who, having
gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and
the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of
shining black faces at every door and window,
gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white
eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from
ear to ear. How could the flogger of urchins be
otherwise than animated and joyous? the lady of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling
graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings;
while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and
jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.</p>

<p>When the dance was at end, Ichabod was
attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with
old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the
piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing
out long stories about the war.</p>

<p>This neighborhood, at the time of which I am
speaking, was one of those highly-favored places
which abound with chronicle and great men. The
British and American lines had run near it during
the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of
marauding, and infested with refugees, cow-boys,
and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient
time had elapsed to enable each story-teller to
dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction,
and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to
make himself the hero of every exploit.</p>

<p>There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large,
blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a
British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from
a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the
sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman
who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer
to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of
Whiteplains, being an excellent master of defence,
parried a musket ball with a small sword, insomuch
that he absolutely felt it whiz round the
blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which,
he was ready at any time to show the sword, with
the hilt a little bent. There were several more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
that had been equally great in the field, not one
of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable
hand in bringing the war to a happy
termination.</p>

<p>But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts
and apparitions that succeeded. The neighborhood
is rich in legendary treasures of the kind.
Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these
sheltered, long-settled retreats; but are trampled
under foot by the shifting throng that forms the
population of most of our country places. Besides,
there is no encouragement for ghosts in most
of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to
finish their first nap, and turn themselves in their
graves, before their surviving friends have travelled
away from the neighborhood; so that when
they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they
have no acquaintance left to call upon. This
is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear
of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch
communities.</p>

<p>The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence
of supernatural stories in these parts, was
doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow.
There was a contagion in the very air that blew
from that haunted region; it breathed forth an
atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the
land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were
present at Van Tassel’s, and, as usual, were doling
out their wild and wonderful legends. Many
dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and
mourning cries and wailings heard and seen above
the great tree where the unfortunate Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
André was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood.
Some mention was made also of the
woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at
Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on
winter nights before a storm, having perished
there in the snow. The chief part of the stories,
however, turned upon the favorite specter of
Sleepy Hollow, the headless horseman, who had
been heard several times of late, patrolling the
country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly
among the graves in the churchyard.</p>

<p>The sequestered situation of this church seems
always to have made it a favorite haunt of
troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded
by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which
its decent whitewashed walls shine modestly forth,
like Christian purity beaming through the shades
of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it
to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees,
between which peeps may be caught at the
blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown
yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so
quietly, one would think that there at least the
dead might rest in peace. On one side of the
church extends a wide woody dell, along which
raves a large brook among broken rocks and
trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part
of the stream, not far from the church, was
formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that
led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded
by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about
it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful
darkness at night. This was one of the favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
haunts of the headless horseman; and the place
where he was most frequently encountered. The
tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical
disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the horseman
returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and
was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped
over bush and brake, over hill and swamp,
until they reached the bridge; when the horseman
suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer
into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops
with a clap of thunder.</p>

<p>This story was immediately matched by a thrice
marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made
light of the galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey.
He affirmed that, on returning one night from the
neighboring village of Sing-Sing, he had been overtaken
by this midnight trooper; that he had offered
to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should
have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse
all hollow, but, just as they came to the church
bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash
of fire.</p>

<p>All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone
with which men talk in the dark, the countenances
of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual
gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the
mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with
large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton
Mather, and added many marvellous events that
had taken place in his native State of Connecticut,
and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly
walks about Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<p>The revel now gradually broke up. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
farmers gathered together their families in their
wagons, and were heard for some time rattling
along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills.
Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind
their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter,
mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along
the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter
until they gradually died away—and the late
scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted.
Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom
of country lovers, to have a tête-à-tête with
the heiress, fully convinced that he was now on the
highroad to success. What passed at this interview
I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not
know. Something, however, I fear me, must have
gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no
great interval, with an air quite desolate and chop-fallen.—Oh
these women! these women! Could
that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish
tricks?—Was her encouragement of the poor
pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest
of his rival?—Heaven only knows, not I!—Let
it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of
one who had been sacking a hen-roost, rather than
a fair lady’s heart. Without looking to the right
or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which
he had so often gloated, he went straight to the
stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks,
roused the steed most uncourteously from the comfortable
quarters in which he was soundly sleeping,
dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole
valleys of timothy and clover.</p>

<p>It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
heavy-hearted and crest-fallen, pursued his
travel homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills
which rise above Tarrytown, and which he had
traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour
was as dismal as himself. Far below him, the Tappan
Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of
waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop,
riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the
dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking
of the watch-dog from the opposite shore of
the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only
to give an idea of his distance from this faithful
companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn
crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened,
would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse
away among the hills—but it was like a dreaming
sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near
him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a
cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull-frog,
from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping
uncomfortably, and turning suddenly in his bed.</p>

<p>All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had
heard in the afternoon, now came crowding upon
his recollection. The night grew darker and darker;
the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving
clouds occasionally hid them from his sight.
He had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was,
moreover, approaching the very place where many
of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid.
In the center of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree,
which towered like a giant above all the other
trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of
landmark. Its limbs were gnarled, and fantastic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees,
twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again
into the air. It was connected with the tragical
story of the unfortunate André, who had been
taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known
by the name of Major André’s tree. The common
people regarded it with a mixture of respect and
superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of
its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales
of strange sights and doleful lamentations told
concerning it.</p>

<p>As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began
to whistle: he thought his whistle was answered—it
was but a blast sweeping sharply through the
dry branches. As he approached a little nearer,
he thought he saw something white hanging in the
midst of the tree—he paused and ceased whistling,
but on looking more narrowly, perceived that it
was a place where the tree had been scathed by
lightning; and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly
he heard a groan—his teeth chattered and his
knees smote against the saddle: it was but the
rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they
were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the
tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards from the tree a small
brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and
thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley’s
Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served
for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the
road where the brook entered the wood, a group of
oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grapevines,
threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this
identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured,
and under the covert of those chestnuts and
vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised
him. This has ever since been considered a
haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the
schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.</p>

<p>As he approached the stream his heart began to
thump; he summoned up, however, all his resolution,
gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs,
and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge;
but instead of starting forward, the perverse old
animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside
against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased
with the delay, jerked the reins on the
other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary
foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true,
but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the
road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes.
The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and
heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder,
who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but
came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness
that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over
his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by
the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of
Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the
margin of the brook, he beheld something huge,
misshapen, black and towering. It stirred not, but
seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic
monster ready to spring upon the traveller.</p>

<p>The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon
his head with terror. What was to be done? To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what
chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if
such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the
wind? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage,
he demanded in stammering accents—“Who
are you?” He received no reply. He repeated
his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still
there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the
sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his
eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a
psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of
alarm put itself in motion, and, with a scramble
and a bound, stood at once in the middle of the
road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet
the form of the unknown might now in some degree
be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of
large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of
powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation
or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road,
jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder,
who had now got over his fright and waywardness.</p>

<p>Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight
companion, and bethought himself of the adventure
of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian,
now quickened his steed, in hopes of leaving
him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his
horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up, and
fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind—the other
did the same. His heart began to sink within
him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but
his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth,
and he could not utter a stave. There was something
in the moody and dogged silence of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
pertinacious companion, that was mysterious and
appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for.
On mounting a rising ground, which brought the
figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the
sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak,
Ichabod was horror-struck, on perceiving that he
was headless!—but his horror was still more increased,
on observing that the head, which should
have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him
on the pommel of the saddle: his terror rose to
desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows
upon Gunpowder, hoping, by a sudden movement,
to give his companion the slip—but the specter
started full jump with him. Away then they
dashed, through thick and thin; stones flying, and
sparks flashing at every bound. Ichabod’s flimsy
garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his
long lank body away over his horse’s head, in the
eagerness of his flight.</p>

<p>They had now reached the road which turns off
to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed
possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it,
made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong
down hill to the left. This road leads through a
sandy hollow, shaded by trees for about a quarter
of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in
goblin story, and just beyond swells the green
knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.</p>

<p>As yet the panic of the steed had given his
unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the
chase; but just as he had got half way through the
hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and
he felt it slipping from under him. He seized it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm,
but in vain; and had just time to save himself by
clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when
the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it
trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a
moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper’s wrath
passed across his mind—for it was his Sunday
saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the
goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful
rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain
his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes
on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge
of his horse’s backbone, with a violence that he
verily feared would cleave him asunder.</p>

<p>An opening in the trees now cheered him with
the hopes that the church bridge was at hand.
The wavering reflection of a silver star in the
bosom of the brook told him he was not
mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly
glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected
the place where Brom Bone’s ghostly competitor
had disappeared. “If I can but reach that
bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just
then he heard the black steed panting and blowing
close behind him; he even fancied that he
felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick
in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the
bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks;
he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod
cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should
vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and
brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in
his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the
horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his
cranium with a tremendous crash—he was tumbled
headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black
steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>The next morning the old horse was found without
his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet,
soberly cropping the grass at his master’s gate.
Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast—dinner-hour
came, but no Ichabod. The boys
assembled at the school-house, and strolled idly
about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster.
Hans Van Ripper now began to feel
some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod,
and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and
after diligent investigation they came upon his
traces. In one part of the road leading to the
church was found the saddle trampled in the
dirt; the tracks of horses’ hoofs deeply dented
in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were
traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank
of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran
deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate
Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered
pumpkin.</p>

<p>The brook was searched, but the body of the
schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van
Ripper, as executor of his estate, examined the
bundle which contained all his worldly effects.
They consisted of two shorts and a half; two stocks
for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings;
an old pair of corduroy smallclothes; a rusty razor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
a book of psalm tunes, full of dogs’ ears; and a
broken pitchpipe. As to the books and furniture
of the school-house, they belonged to the community,
excepting Cotton Mather’s History of
Witchcraft, a New England Almanac, and a book
of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a
sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in
several fruitless attempts to make a copy of
verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel.
These magic books and the poetic scrawl were
forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van
Ripper; who from that time forward determined
to send his children no more to school; observing,
that he never knew any good come of this same
reading and writing. Whatever money the
schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his
quarter’s pay but a day or two before, he must
have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.</p>

<p>The mysterious event caused much speculation
at the church on the following Sunday. Knots of
gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard,
at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat
and pumpkin had been found. The stories of
Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others,
were called to mind; and when they had diligently
considered them all, and compared them with the
symptoms of the present case, they shook their
heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod
had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian.
As he was a bachelor, and in nobody’s debt,
nobody troubled his head any more about him.
The school was removed to a different quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his
stead.</p>

<p>It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to
New York on a visit several years after, and from
whom this account of the ghostly adventure was
received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod
Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood,
partly through fear of the goblin and
Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at
having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that
he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the
country; had kept school and studied law at the
same time, had been admitted to the bar, turned
politician, electioneered, written for the newspapers,
and finally had been made a justice of the
Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who shortly
after his rival’s disappearance conducted the blooming
Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed
to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story
of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a
hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which
led some to suspect that he knew more about the
matter than he chose to tell.</p>

<p>The old country wives, however, who are the best
judges of these matters, maintain to this day that
Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means;
and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood
round the winter evening fire. The bridge
became more than ever an object of superstitious
awe, and that may be the reason why the road has
been altered of late years, so as to approach the
church by the border of the mill-pond. The school-house
being deserted, soon fell to decay, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate
pedagogue; and the plough-boy, loitering
homeward of a still summer evening, has often
fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy
psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of
Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<h2 id="THE_HARE_WHO_THOUGHT_THE">THE HARE WHO THOUGHT THE
WORLD HAD COME TO
AN END</h2>

<p class="author">Translated by H. N. Francis</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time there was near the Western
Ocean a grove of palm and vilva trees. A
certain Hare lived here beneath a palm sapling, at
the foot of a vilva tree. One day this Hare after
feeding came and lay down beneath a young
palm tree, and the thought struck him: “If this
earth should be destroyed, what would become of
me?”</p>

<p>At this very moment a ripe vilva fruit fell on a
palm leaf. At the sound of it the Hare suddenly
thought, “This solid earth is collapsing,” and starting
up he fled without so much as looking behind
him.</p>

<p>Another Hare saw him scampering off as if
frightened to death, and asked the cause of his sudden
flight. “Pray don’t ask me,” he said. The second
Hare, followed, crying, “Pray, sir, what is it?”
and kept running after him.</p>

<p>Then the Hare stopped a moment and, without
looking back, he said, “The earth here is breaking
up.” And at this the second Hare ran after the
first. And then first one and then another Hare
caught sight of him running and joined in the
chase, till one hundred thousand Hares all took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
their flight together. They were seen by a Deer,
a Boar, an Elk, a Buffalo, a Wild Ox, a Rhinoceros,
a Tiger, a Lion and an Elephant. And
when they asked what it meant and were told
that the earth was breaking up, they too took to
flight. By degrees this host of animals was a
league long.</p>

<p>A wise Brahmin who saw this headlong flight of
animals, and was told that the cause of it was that
the earth was coming to an end, thought: “The
earth is nowhere coming to an end. Surely it must
be some sound which was misunderstood by them.
If I don’t make a great effort they will all perish.
I will save their lives.” With the speed of a lion
he got before them to the foot of a mountain,
and roared three times like a lion. They were
terribly frightened and stopped in their flight,
standing all huddled together. The Brahmin, in
the guise of a Lion, went amongst them and asked
why they were running away.</p>

<p>“The earth is collapsing,” they answered.</p>

<p>“Who saw it collapsing?” he said.</p>

<p>“The Elephants know all about it,” they replied.
He asked the Elephants, but they didn’t know.
They said the Lions knew. But the Lions said,
“We don’t know; the Tigers know.” The Tigers
said, “The Wild Oxen know.” The Wild Oxen,
“The Buffaloes.” The Buffaloes, “The Elks.”
The Elks, “The Boars.” The Boars, “The Deer.”
The Deer said, “We don’t know; the Hares
know.” When the Hares were questioned they
pointed to one particular Hare and said, “This
one told us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Brahmin went up to him and asked, “Is
it true, sir, that the earth is breaking up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I saw it,” said the Hare.</p>

<p>“Where,” he asked, “were you living when you
saw it?”</p>

<p>“Near the ocean, sir, in a grove of palm and vilva
trees. As I was lying beneath the shade of a palm
sapling at the foot of a vilva tree, I thought, ‘If this
earth should break up, where shall I go?’ And at
that very moment I heard the sound of the earth
breaking up, and I fled.”</p>

<p>The Lion thought to himself: “A ripe vilva fruit
evidently must have fallen on a palm leaf and made
a ‘thud,’ and this Hare jumped to the conclusion
that the earth was coming to an end, and ran away.
I will find out the exact truth about it.” So he reassured
the herd of animals and said: “I will take the
Hare and go and find out exactly whether the earth
is coming to an end or not, in the place pointed out
by him. Until I return do you stay here.” Then,
placing the Hare on his back, he sprang forward
with the speed of a lion, and putting the Hare down
in a palm grove, he said, “Come, show us the place
you meant.”</p>

<p>“I dare not, my lord,” said the Hare.</p>

<p>“Come, don’t be afraid,” said the Lion. The
Hare, not daring to go near the vilva tree, stood
afar off and cried, “Yonder, sir, is the place of
dreadful sounds.”</p>

<p>The Lion went to the foot of the vilva tree, and
saw the spot where the Hare had been lying beneath
the shade of the palm tree, and the ripe vilva
fruit that fell on the palm leaf, and having ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
that the earth had not broken up, he placed
the Hare on his back and with the speed of a lion
soon came again to the herd of beasts.</p>

<p>He told them the whole story, and having thus
reassured the herd of beasts he let them go.</p>

SAPLINGS</h2>

<p class="author">Translated by Rev. W. H. D. Rouse</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time a king named Vissasena
was reigning over the city of Benares, and
proclamation was made of a holiday. The park-keeper
thought he would take a holiday, so,
calling the Monkeys that lived in the park, he
said:</p>

<p>“This park is a great blessing to you. I want to
take a week’s holiday. Will you water the saplings
on the seventh day?” “Oh, yes,” they
said. He gave them the watering skins, and
went away.</p>

<p>The Monkeys drew water and began to water
the roots, when the eldest Monkey cried out:</p>

<p>“Wait, now! It’s hard to get water. We must
not waste it. Let us pull up the plants, and notice
the length of their roots; if they have long roots,
they need plenty of water; but short ones need
but a little.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” they agreed; so some of them
pulled up the plants while others put them back
and watered them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_OLD_HARE_AND_THE">THE OLD HARE AND THE
ELEPHANTS</h2>

<p class="author">Translated by Sir Edwin Arnold</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once on a time very little rain had fallen in
the due season; and the Elephants, being
oppressed with thirst, thus addressed their leader:
“Master, how are we to live? The small creatures
find something to wash in, but we cannot, and we
are half dead in consequence; whither shall we go
then, and what shall we do?”</p>

<p>Upon that the King of the Elephants led them
away a little distance and showed them a beautiful
pool of water clear as crystal, where they took their
ease.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that a company of Hares resided
on the banks of the pool and the going and coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
of the Elephants trampled many of them to death,
till one of their number grumbled out, “This troop
will be coming here to water every day, and every
one of our family will be crushed.”</p>

<p>“Do not disquiet yourself,” said an old Buck
Hare named Good-speed; “I will manage to stop
it,” and so saying, he set off bethinking himself on
his way how he should approach and accost a herd
of Elephants; for</p>

</div>

<p>“I will get on the top of a hill,” he thought,
“and address the Elephants from there.”</p>

<p>This being done, and the lord of the herd perceiving
him, it was asked of the Hare, “Who art
thou? and whence comest thou?”</p>

<p>“I am an ambassador from His Godship the
Moon,” replied Good-speed.</p>

<p>“State your business,” said the Elephant King.</p>

<p>“Sire,” began the Hare, “an ambassador speaks
the truth safely by reason of his position. Thus
saith the Moon then: “These Hares were the guardians
of my pool, and thine Elephants in coming
here have scared them away. This is not well. Am
I not “S’às’anka” whose banner bears a hare, and
are not these Hares my followers?” “Please your
worship,” said the Elephant King with much fear,
“we knew nothing of this; we will go there no
more.”</p>

<p>“It were well,” said the make-believe ambassador,
“that you first make your apologies to the God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
who is quaking with rage in his pool, and then went
about your business.”</p>

<p>“We will do so,” replied the Elephant with meekness;
and being led by night to the pool, in the ripples
of which the image of the Moon was quivering,
the herd made their prostrations; the Hare explaining
to the Moon that their fault was committed in
ignorance, and therefore they got their dismissal.</p>

<h2 id="THE_ELEPHANT_HAS_A_BET">THE ELEPHANT HAS A BET
WITH THE TIGER</h2>

<p class="author">By Walter Skeat, M.R.A.S., F.A.L.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the beginning Gajah the Elephant and Rimau
the Tiger were sworn friends. But one day
they came to a clearing and presently encountered
Lobong, the long-tailed Spectacle-Monkey. And
when he saw the Monkey the Elephant said, “Mr.
Lobong yonder is far too noisy; let us try and
shake him off; if he falls to me I am to eat you;
and if he falls to you, you are to eat me—we will
make a wager of it.” The Tiger said, “Agreed?”
and the Elephant replied, “Agreed.” “Very well!”
said the Tiger; “you shall try and menace him
first.” So the Elephant tried to menace the Monkey.
“<i>Au! Au! Au!</i>” he trumpeted, and each
time he trumpeted the Monkey was scared. But
the Monkey went jumping head foremost through
the branches and never fell to the ground at all.</p>

<p>Presently, therefore, the Tiger asked the Elephant,
“Well, Friend Elephant, would you like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
try your luck again?” But the Elephant said, “No,
thank you. It shall be your turn now; and if he
falls to you, you shall eat me—if you really can
make him fall!”</p>

<p>Then the Tiger went and roared his longest and
loudest and shortened his body as for a spring and
growled and menaced the Monkey thrice. And the
Monkey leaped and fell at the Tiger’s feet, for his
feet and hands were paralyzed and would not grip
the branches any more. Then the Tiger said,
“Well, Friend Elephant, I suppose I may eat you
now!” But the Elephant said, “You have, I admit,
won the wager; but I beg you to grant me just
seven days’ respite, to enable me to visit my wife
and children and to make my will.” The Tiger
granted the request, and the Elephant went home,
bellowing and sobbing every foot of the way.</p>

<p>Now the Elephant’s wife heard the sound of her
husband’s voice, and said to her children, “What
can be the matter with your father that he keeps
sobbing so?” And the children listened to make
sure and said, “Yes, it really is father’s voice, the
sobbing, and not that of anybody else.” Presently
Father Elephant arrived, and Mother Elephant
asked, “What were you sobbing for, father?
What have you done to yourself?” Father Elephant
replied, “I made a wager with Friend Tiger
about shaking down a Monkey, and Friend Tiger
beat me; I menaced the Monkey, but he did not
fall; if he had fallen to me, I was to have eaten
Friend Tiger, but if he fell to Friend Tiger, Friend
Tiger was to eat me. I was beaten, and now Friend
Tiger says he is going to eat me. So I begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
leave to come home and see you, and he has given
me just seven days’ respite.”</p>

<p>Now for the seven days Father Elephant kept
sobbing aloud, and neither ate nor slept. And the
thing came to the hearing of Friend Mouse-deer.
“What can be the matter with Friend Elephant
that he keeps bellowing and bellowing, neither does
he sleep, so that night is turned into day, and day
into night? What on earth is the matter with
him? Suppose I go and see” (said the Mouse-deer).
Then the Mouse-deer went to see what was
wrong, and asked, “What is the matter with you,
Friend Elephant, that we hear you bellowing and
bellowing every single day and every single night,
just now, too, when the Rams are upon us? You
are far too noisy.”</p>

<p>But the Elephant said, “It is no mere empty
noise, Friend Mouse-deer, I have got into a dreadful
scrape.” “What sort of a scrape?” inquired the
Mouse-deer. “I made a wager with Friend Tiger
about shaking down a Monkey, and he beat me.”
“What was the stake?” asked the Mouse-deer.
“The stake was that Friend Tiger might eat me if
Friend Tiger frightened it down; and if I frightened
it down, I might eat Friend Tiger. It fell to
Friend Tiger, and now Friend Tiger wants to eat
me. And my reason for not eating or sleeping any
more is that I have got only just seven days’ respite
to go home and visit my wife and children and
to make my will.” Then the Mouse-deer said, “If
it came to Friend Tiger’s eating you, I should feel
exceedingly sorrowful, exceedingly distressed; but
things being only as you say, I feel neither.” “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
you will assist me, I will become your slave, and my
descendant shall be your slaves forever.” “Very
well, if that is the case, I will assist you,” said the
Mouse-deer. “Go and look for a jar full of molasses.”
Friend Elephant promised to do so, and
went to look for it at the house of a maker of Palm-wine.
The owner of the house fled for his life, and
the jar fell into Friend Elephant’s possession, who
bore it back to the Mouse-deer.</p>

<p>Then Friend Mouse-deer said, “When does your
promise expire?” and Friend Elephant replied,
“To-morrow.” So when next morning arrived they
started, and the Mouse-deer said, “Now pour the
molasses over your back and let it spread and spread
and run down your legs.” Friend Elephant did
as he was ordered. Friend Mouse-deer then instructed
the Elephant as follows: “As soon as I
begin to lick up the molasses on your back, bellow
as loud as you can and make believe to be hurt, and
writhe and wriggle this way and that.”</p>

<p>And presently Friend Mouse-deer commenced to
lick hard, and Friend Elephant writhed and wriggled
and made believe to be hurt, and made a
prodigious noise of trumpeting. In this way they
proceeded and Friend Mouse-deer got up and sat
astride upon Friend Elephant’s back. And the
Elephant trumpeted and trumpeted all the way
till they met with Friend Tiger. At this Friend
Mouse-deer exclaimed, “A single Elephant is very
short commons; if I could only catch that big and
fat old Tiger there, it would be just enough to satisfy
my hunger.”</p>

<p>Now when Friend Tiger heard these words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the Mouse-deer, he said to himself, “So I suppose
if you catch me, you’ll eat me into the bargain, will
you?” And Friend Tiger stayed not a moment
longer, but fled for his life, fetching very lofty
bounds. And soon he met with the Black Ape,
and Friend Ape asked, “Why running so hard,
Friend Tiger? Why so much noise, and why, just
when the Rams are upon us, too, do you go fetching
such lofty bounds?” Friend Tiger replied,
“What do you mean by ‘So much noise’? What
was the Thing that was got upon Friend Elephant’s
back, that had caught Friend Elephant and
was devouring him so that he went writhing and
wriggling for the pain of it, and the blood went
streaming down in floods? Moreover the Thing
that was on Friend Elephant’s back said, to my
hearing, that a single Elephant was very short commons;
but if It could catch a fat old Tiger like
myself that would be just enough to satisfy Its
hunger.” Friend Ape said, “What was that Thing,
Friend Tiger?” “I don’t know,” said the Tiger.
“Ah,” mused the Ape, “I wonder if It <em>could</em> be
Friend Mouse-deer!” “Certainly not,” said the
Tiger; “why, how in the world could Friend
Mouse-deer swallow <em>Me</em>? To say nothing of his not
being used to meat food” (said he). “Come and
let us go back again.”</p>

<p>Then they went back again to find the Elephant,
and first the Ape went the faster, and then the Tiger
went the faster, and then the Ape got in front
again. But Friend Mouse-deer sitting on Friend
Elephant’s back saw them coming and shouted,
“Hallo, Father Ape” (said he), “this is a dog’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
trick indeed; you promise to bring me two Tigers
and you only bring me one. I refuse to accept it,
Father Ape.”</p>

<p>Now when the Tiger heard this, he ran off at
first as fast as he could, but presently he slackened
his pace and said, “It is too bad of you, Friend
Ape, for trying to cozen me in order to pay your
own debts. For shame! Father Ape! It was only
through good luck that he refused to accept me; if
he had accepted, I should have been dead and done
with. So now, if you come down to the ground,
you shall die the death yourself, just for your trying
to cheat me.”</p>

<p>Thus the Tiger and the Ape were set at enmity,
and to this day the Tiger is very wroth with the
Ape for trying to cheat him. And here the story
ends.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_THE_TORTOISE_OUTRAN_THE">HOW THE TORTOISE OUTRAN THE
DEER</h2>

<p class="author">By C. F. Hartt</p>

<p class="dropcap">A Tortoise met a Deer out walking, one
day, and asked him what he was looking for.
The Deer answered, “I am out for a walk, to see if
I cannot find something to eat; and pray where are
you going, Tortoise?”</p>

<p>“Oh, out walking, looking for water to drink.”</p>

<p>“How soon do you expect to reach the water?”
asked the Deer.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question?” returned the
Tortoise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because your legs are so short.”</p>

<p>“Well!” answered the Tortoise, “I can run faster
than you can. If you are long-legged you cannot
run so fast as I.”</p>

<p>“Then let us run a race!” said the Deer.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the Tortoise, “when shall we
run?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p>“At what time?”</p>

<p>“Very early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented the Tortoise, who then
went into the forest and called together his relations,
the other Tortoises, saying, “Come on, let’s
catch him!”</p>

<p>“But how are you going to catch him?” they
inquired.</p>

<p>“I said to the Deer,” answered the Tortoise,
“‘Let us run a race, to see who can run the faster.’
Now I am going to cheat that Deer. You scatter
yourselves along the edge of the campo, in the
forest, keeping not very far from one another, and
see that you keep perfectly still, each in his place!
To-morrow, when we begin the race, the deer will
run on the campo, but I will remain quietly in my
place. When he calls out to me, if you are ahead
of him, answer, but take care not to respond if he
has passed you.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Deer went out to
meet the Tortoise.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the former, “let us run!”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit!” said the Tortoise, “I am going to
run in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Why, how are you, a little, short-legged fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
going to run in the forest?” asked the Deer, surprised.</p>

<p>The Tortoise insisted that he could not run in the
campo, but that he was accustomed to run in the
forest, so the Deer assented, and the Tortoise went
into the woods, saying: “When I take my position I
will make a noise with a little stick, so that you may
know I am ready.”</p>

<p>When the Tortoise, having reached his place,
gave the signal, the Deer started off leisurely,
laughing to himself, not thinking it worth his while
to run. After the Deer had gone quite a little distance,
he turned round and called out, “Hullo,
Tortoise!” When to his astonishment, a Tortoise
a little way ahead cried out, “Hullo, Deer!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Deer to himself, “that Tortoise
does run fast!” Whereupon he hurried up for a
bit and then called out again, but the voice of the
Tortoise still seemed to be beyond him.</p>

<p>“Why, how’s this?” exclaimed the Deer, and he
ran briskly for a little ways till, thinking that he
surely must have passed the Tortoise, he stopped,
turned about, and called again. “Hullo, Deer!”
the answer came from the edge of the forest just
ahead.</p>

<p>On this the Deer set off at full speed, and, after
a little, but without stopping this time, he called to
the Tortoise. And still the cry, “Hullo, Deer!”
came back to him from ahead. He then redoubled
his forces, but with no better success, and at last,
tired and bewildered, he ran against a tree and fell
dead.</p>

<p>The noise made by the feet of the Deer having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
ceased, the first Tortoise listened. Not a sound
was heard. Then he called to the Deer, but received
no response. So he went to see what was
the matter and found the Deer lying at the foot
of the tree.</p>

<h2 id="WHICH_WAS_THE_STRONGER_THE">WHICH WAS THE STRONGER, THE
TORTOISE, THE TAPIR, OR
THE WHALE?</h2>

<p class="author">By C. F. Hartt</p>

<p class="dropcap">One day a Tortoise went down to the sea to
drink. A Whale saw him and called out:
“Here, what are you doing, Tortoise?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m drinking, ’cause I’m thirsty.”</p>

<p>Then the Whale began to make fun of the Tortoise’s
short legs, but the Tortoise indignantly
replied: “Even if my legs are short, I am stronger
than you, and I can pull you on shore.”</p>

<p>The Whale laughed, “Come on, let me see you
do it!”</p>

<p>“Well!” said the Tortoise, “just wait until I go
into the forest and get a sipó!”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Away went the Tortoise into the forest, and
there he met a Tapir, who asked him what he was
looking for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am looking for a sipó.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do with a sipó?”
asked the Tapir.</p>

<p>“I want it to pull you down to the sea.”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed the Tapir, surprised. “I’ll
pull you into the forest, and, what’s more—but
never mind, let’s try who may be the stronger! Go
get your sipó!” The Tortoise went off, and presently
came back with a very long sipó, one end of
which he tied around the body of the Tapir.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Tortoise, “wait here until I go
down to the sea. When I shake this sipó, run with
all your might into the forest.” Having attached
one end to the Tapir, he dragged the other down to
the sea and fastened it to the tail of the Whale.
This accomplished, he said, “I will go up into the
forest, and when I shake the sipó, pull as hard as
you can, for I am going to draw you on shore.”</p>

<p>The Tortoise then went into the wood, midway
between the Whale and the Tapir, shook the sipó,
and awaited the result. First the Whale, swimming
vigorously, dragged the Tapir backward to
the sea, but the latter, resisting with all his might,
finally gained a firm foothold and began to get the
better of the Whale, drawing him in toward the
shore. Then the Whale made another effort, and
in this manner they kept tugging against one
another, each thinking the Tortoise at the other
end of the sipó, until at last, both gave up the
struggle from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>The Tortoise then walked down to the shore, and
the Whale called out to him: “Well, you certainly
are strong, Tortoise; I am very tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tortoise untied the sipó from the Whale,
and, having dipped himself in the water, went
over to where the Tapir was puffing after his
labors.</p>

<p>“Well, Tapir,” he said, as he untied the sipó,
“you see that I am the stronger.”</p>

<p>“It is true, Tortoise, you are very, very strong.”</p>

<h2 id="HOW_THE_TURTLE_GOT_HIS">HOW THE TURTLE GOT HIS
SHELL</h2>

<p class="author">By Annie Ker</p>

<p class="dropcap">Long ago, our fathers have told us, the Turtle
and the Wallaby were friends. Now on a
certain day the Turtle was hungry, and asked his
friend to go with him to the beach and from thence
to the Hornbill’s garden, where was much sugarcane
and where bananas also were plentiful. This
they did, and fed plentifully on all that was there.
The Wallaby trod upon the stalks of the bananas
and bowed them to the ground that his friend
might eat. Thus did he also to the tall sugarcanes
and the flowering rush. And they both did eat
and their hunger was stayed.</p>

<p>Now while they were eating the Birds were at
work in their gardens, tilling the ground. When
the work was finished they dug up much taro and
returned to the village to cook their food. They
peeled the roots and cut them up and placed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
in the pots for cooking. Then said Binama
the Hornbill, “Let one of you go down to the
beach and bring sea water that our food may be
salted.”</p>

<p>But nothing came of it, for one by one the Birds
made excuse, fearing lest an enemy lay in wait.
At last the Wagtail arose, and ran into the house to
make ready to go to the beach. He hung his shell
breastplate round his neck, tied waving feathers
round his head, and took his spear and went forth.
As he went he leaped from side to side the better to
avoid the foe, if foe there were. In a little while he
came to Binama’s garden and saw the Turtle and
Wallaby feeding. Their hearts trembled; nevertheless
the Turtle made bold and said to the Wagtail,
“Thy master has bidden us eat of his bananas
that our hunger may be stayed.”</p>

<p>Now the Wagtail knew in his heart that they
lied, but he answered never a word, but filled his
bottles with sea water and ran back to the village
by another way. When he reached the village he
cried aloud, “Friends, the Turtle and the Wallaby
are eating in our master’s garden!” At this word
all arose and ran for their spears, and surrounded
the garden. The Wallaby lifted up his head, and
seeing naught but enemies round about him, tarried
not but leaped mightily, and escaped. The
Turtle could not jump, as he well knew, so he
crawled with haste into a yam patch and hid himself
under the leaves.</p>

<p>The Birds knew he was still there, and they
hunted for him diligently until they found him
and dragged him forth. The Turtle feared greatly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
and cried, “Take not vengeance on me, for truly
the Wallaby bade me come hither and with his feet
he broke the stalks, while I only ate of the fruit.”
The Birds cared little for his words, and tied
him to a pole and thus carried him to Binama’s
house, where they laid him upon a shelf till the
morrow.</p>

<p>The next day Binama called his servants together
and all went to dig food to make a feast,
when they should slay the Turtle. None were in
the house but the children whom Binama had set
to guard the captive. Then the Turtle made his
voice soft, and called to the children, “Loosen my
bonds, O children,” quoth he, “that we may play
together.” Now the children knew not what was
in the Turtle’s mind, and they did as he bade them.
He crawled down from the shelf, and stretched
himself, for he was stiff and sore. Then he said
to the children, “Where are your ornaments?
Leave the poor ones in the basket, and bring forth
only the good ones, that I may see them.”</p>

<p>The children ran to the place where Binama kept
his ornaments, and brought forth a long necklace
of shell money, also two shell armlets and a wooden
bowl, and laid them before the Turtle. He forthwith
wound the necklace many times round his
neck, and put on both the shell armlets. Moreover
the bowl he fastened upon his back. Then he
said to the children, “Ye behold me now richly
attired. Watch while I run a little and back again,
and tell me if the sight is a good one or no.”</p>

<p>The children watched him crawl a few paces and
called him to return. This the Turtle did and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
sat together in the shade of a tree. Then the
Turtle crawled once more, and the children laughed
to watch his ungainly form decorated with their
father’s ornaments. Again the Turtle returned to
the children, but this time he did not sit with them.
For on a sudden he heard voices and knew the men
were drawing near. Then he saw them as they
came forth, and ran swiftly to the sea. The children
cried aloud to their father, “Come, for the
Turtle is running away!”</p>

<p>When Binama heard this cry, he and the Birds
with him threw the sheaves of taro aside and gave
chase to the runaway. But the Turtle had already
reached the sea, and he hastened to dive. The
Birds called, “Show thyself now. Lift up thy
head.” So the Turtle did so, and the angry Birds
cast great stones into the sea, and the left armlet
which the turtle wore was shattered. So he dived,
but they called again, “Show thyself. Lift up thy
head,” and a stone fell upon the right armlet and
broke it into small pieces. Again they called, and
again the Turtle raised himself in the water, and
this time the stones cut the string on which the
necklace of shell money was threaded.</p>

<p>And now for the last time came the call, “Show
thyself. Lift up thy head.” The Turtle once
more raised himself and the Birds flung after him
all the great stones they could find. They fell in
scores upon the wooden bowl which had been
carried away from Binama’s home, but it was not
destroyed, nay, nor was it harmed at all. And the
Turtle fled far over the sea, nor was he seen again
of Binama or his followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>But since that day even until now, so our
fathers have told us, all turtles carry upon their
backs the bowl which in the old days was in the
house of Binama.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Wahieroa had been treacherously slain
by a chief named Matuku, so it became the
duty of his young son Rata to revenge his father’s
death. By the time he had grown up he had devised
a plan for doing this, and gave the necessary orders
to his followers. He then started on a journey.</p>

<p>Arrived at the entrance to Matuku’s place he
found a Man sitting in the courtyard who had been
left in charge.</p>

<p>“Where is the man who killed my father?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“He lives down in the earth and I call to warn
him when the new moon appears. That is when
he comes upon earth to do battle.”</p>

day.”</p>

<p>On the morning appointed, Rata returned and
found the Man sitting in the same place.</p>

<p>“Do you know any spot where I can conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
myself from the enemy with whom I am about to
fight?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The Man replied, “Come with me and I will show
you the two fountains of clear water.”</p>

<p>“This spot that we stand on,” said the Man, when
they arrived at the place, “is the place where
Matuku rises up from the earth, and yonder fountain
is the one on which he combs and washes his
dishevelled hair; but this fountain is the one he uses
to reflect his face in while he dresses it. You can
not kill him while he is at the fountain he uses
to reflect his face in, because your shadow would
also be reflected in it and he would see it; but at the
fountain in which he washes his hair you may smite
and slay him.”</p>

<p>“Will he make his appearance this evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They had not waited long when the moon became
visible and the Man told Rata to hide himself
near the brink of the fountain in which Matuku
would wash his hair. Then he shouted aloud,
“Ho, ho, the new moon is visible—a moon two
days old.”</p>

<p>Matuku heard him and, seizing his two-handed
wooden sword, rose from the earth. He laid his
sword on the ground at the edge of the fountain
where he dressed his hair, and kneeling down on
both sides of it he loosened the strings which bound
up his long locks, shook them out, and plunged his
head into the clear cool water. Rata crept out
from where he lay hid, and rapidly moved up and
stood behind him. As Matuku raised his head
above the water Rata with one hand seized him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
the hair, while with the other he smote and slew
him.</p>

<p>“Where shall I find the bones of my father?” he
next asked the Keeper.</p>

<p>“They are not here; a strange people who live at
a distance came and carried them off.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this reply Rata returned to his
village to think matters over. He went to the
forest and, having found a very tall tree that grew
straight throughout its entire length, he felled it
and cut its noble branching tops, intending to
fashion the trunk into a canoe.</p>

<p>The Insects which inhabit trees and the Spirits
of the Forest were very angry at this, and as soon
as Rata had returned to the village, when his day’s
work was done, they took the tree and raised it up
again. The multitude of Insects, Birds and Spirits
worked away at replacing each little chip and
shaving in its proper place, and sang as they
worked:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fly together, chips and shavings,</div>
<div class="verse">Stick ye fast together,</div>
<div class="verse">Hold ye fast together;</div>
<div class="verse">Stand upright again, O tree.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Early the next morning Rata came back. When
he got to the place where he had left the trunk
lying on the ground, he could not at first find it.
That fine tall straight tree, which he saw standing
whole and sound, was the same he thought he had
cut down, and there it was now, erect again; however,
he stepped up to it and, hewing away, he felled
it to the ground once more. Off he cut its fine
branching top, and he began to hollow out the hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of the canoe, and round off the prow and the stern
into their proper, gracefully curved forms. In the
evening when it became too dark to work, he returned
to his village.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone the multitudes of Insects,
Birds and Spirits raised up the tree upon its stump
once more. They sang as they worked, and when
they had ended the tree again stood as sound as ever
in its former place in the forest.</p>

<p>Morning dawned, and Rata returned once more
to work at his canoe. When he reached the place
was not he amazed to see the tree standing,
untouched, just as he had first found it? Nothing
daunted, however, he hews away at it again and
down it topples, crashing to the earth. As soon as
he saw the tree on the ground Rata went off, as
if going home, but turned back and hid himself
in the underwood, in a spot whence he could peep
out and see what took place. He had not been
hidden long when he heard the innumerable multitude
of the children of Tane approaching singing
their incantations, and at last they arrived at the
place where the tree was lying on the ground.</p>

<p>Rata rushed upon them. He seized some of
them, shouting: “Ha, ha, it is you, is it, who have
been exercising your magical arts upon my tree?”</p>

<p>Then the children of Tane all cried aloud in
reply, “Who gave you authority to fell the
forest god to the ground? You had no right to
do so.”</p>

<p>When Rata heard this he was overcome with
shame at what he had done. The children of Tane
called out to him: “Return, O Rata, to thy village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
we will make a canoe for you,” and Rata obeyed
their orders without delay.</p>

<p>They were so numerous and each understood so
well what to do that they had no sooner begun to
adze out a canoe, than it was finished. When the
canoe was afloat upon the sea, one hundred and
forty warriors embarked on board it and they paddled
off to seek their foe.</p>

<p>One night, just at nightfall, they reached the
fortress of their enemy. Rata landed alone, leaving
all his warriors on board. As he stole along the
shore he saw that a fire was burning on the sacred
place where the enemy sacrificed to their gods.
Without stopping he crept directly towards the fire
and hid behind some thick bushes. There were
several priests, and to assist them in their magical
arts they were using the bones of Wahieroa, knocking
them together to beat time while repeating a
powerful incantation known only to themselves.</p>

<p>Rata listened attentively to this incantation until
he had learned it by heart, and when he was quite
sure he knew it he rushed suddenly upon the priests.
Being ignorant of the numbers of the enemy or
whence they came, they made little resistance and
were in a moment overcome. The bones of his
father Wahieroa were then eagerly snatched up.
He hastened with them back to the canoe, embarked
on board it, and his warriors at once paddled away.
Rata’s task of avenging his father’s death being
thus ended, his tribe hauled up his large canoe on
the shore and roofed it over with thatch to protect
it from the sun and weather.</p>

<h2 id="WHY_THE_HIPPOPOTAMUS_LIVES">WHY THE HIPPOPOTAMUS LIVES
IN THE WATER</h2>

<p class="author">By Elphinstone Dayrell, F.R.G.S., F.R.A.I.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Many years ago the Hippopotamus, whose
name was Isantim, was one of the biggest
kings on the land; he was second only to the Elephant.
The Hippo had seven large fat Wives, of
whom he was very fond. Now and then he used
to give a big feast to the people, but a curious thing
was that, although every one knew the Hippo, no
one, except his seven Wives, knew his name.</p>

<p>At one of the feasts, just as the people were
about to sit down, the Hippo said, “You have come
to feed at my table, but none of you know my
name. If you cannot tell my name you shall all of
you go away without your dinner.”</p>

<p>As they could not guess his name, they had to go
away and leave all the good food behind them.
Before they left, however, the Tortoise stood up
and asked the Hippopotamus what he would do if
he told him his name at the next feast? So the
Hippo replied that he would be so ashamed of himself
that he and his whole family would leave the
land, and for the future would dwell in the water.</p>

<p>Now, it was the custom for the Hippo and his
seven Wives to go down every morning and evening
to the river to wash and have a drink. Of
this custom the Tortoise was aware. The Hippo
used to walk first, and the seven Wives followed.
One day when they had gone down to the river to
bathe, the Tortoise made a small hole in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
of the path, and then waited. When the Hippo
and his Wives returned two of the Wives were
some distance behind, so the Tortoise came out
from where he had been hiding and half buried
himself in the hole he had dug, leaving the greater
part of his shell exposed. When the two Hippo
Wives came along, the first one knocked her foot
against the Tortoise’s shell, and immediately called
out to her husband, “Oh, Isantim, my husband, I
have hurt my foot.” At this the Tortoise was very
glad, and went joyfully home.</p>

<p>When the next feast was given by the Hippo, he
made the same condition about his name; so the
Tortoise got up and said, “You promise you will
not kill me if I tell you your name?” and the Hippo
promised. The Tortoise then shouted as loud as he
was able, “Your name is Isantim,” at which a cheer
went up from all the people, and then they sat
down to dinner.</p>

<p>When the feast was over, the Hippo with his
seven Wives, in accordance with his promise, went
down to the river, and they have always lived in the
water from that day till now. Although they come
on shore to feed at night, you never find a Hippo
on the land in the daytime.</p>

<h2 id="WHY_THE_ELEPHANT_HAS">WHY THE ELEPHANT HAS
SMALL EYES</h2>

<p class="author">By Elphinstone Dayrell, F.R.G.S., F.R.A.I.</p>

<p class="dropcap">When Ambo was King of Calabar, the Elephant
was not only a very big animal, but
he had eyes in proportion to his bulk. In those
days men and animals were friends, and all mixed
together quite freely. At regular intervals King
Ambo used to give a feast, and the Elephant used
to eat more than any one, though the Hippopotamus
used to do his best; however, not being as big
as the Elephant, although he was very fat, he was
left a long way behind.</p>

<p>As the Elephant ate so much at these feasts, the
Tortoise, who was small and very cunning, made
up his mind to put a stop to the Elephant eating
more than a fair share of the food provided. He,
therefore, placed some dry kernels and shrimps, of
which the Elephant was very fond, in his bag, and
went to the Elephant’s house to make an afternoon
call.</p>

<p>When the Tortoise arrived the Elephant told
him to sit down, so he made himself comfortable,
and, having shut one eye, took one palm kernel and
a shrimp out of his bag and commenced to eat them
with relish.</p>

<p>When the Elephant saw the Tortoise eating, he
said, as he was always hungry himself, “You seem
to have some good food there; what are you
eating?”</p>

<p>The Tortoise replied that the food was sweet but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
was rather painful, as he was eating one of his eyes;
and he lifted up his head, showing one eye closed.</p>

<p>The Elephant said, “If the food is so good, take
out one of my eyes and give me the same food.”</p>

<p>The Tortoise, who was waiting for this, knowing
how greedy the Elephant was, said, “I cannot reach
your eye, you are so big.” So the Elephant took
the Tortoise in his trunk and lifted him up, and
with one quick scoop he had the Elephant’s eye out.
The Elephant trumpeted with pain, but the Tortoise
gave him some of the dried kernels and
shrimps, and they so pleased the Elephant that he
soon forgot the pain.</p>

<p>Soon the Elephant said, “That food is so sweet I
must have some more;” but the Tortoise told him
that before he could have any the other eye must
come out. To this the Elephant agreed, and soon
the Elephant was quite blind. The Elephant then
began to make a great noise, and started pulling
trees down and doing much damage, calling out
for the Tortoise. The Tortoise had slid down the
Elephant’s trunk to the ground, and hid himself.</p>

<p>The next morning when the Elephant heard the
people passing, he asked them what the time was,
and the Bush Buck, who was nearest, shouted out,
“The sun is now up, and I am going to market to
get some yams and fresh leaves for my food.”</p>

<p>Then the Elephant perceived that the Tortoise
had deceived him, and began to ask all the passers-by
to lend him a pair of eyes, as he could not see,
but every one refused, as they wanted their eyes
themselves. At last the Worm grovelled past, and
seeing the big Elephant, greeted him in his humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
way. He was much surprised when the King of
the Forest returned his salutation, and very much
flattered also.</p>

<p>The Elephant said, “Look here, Worm, I have
mislaid my eyes. Will you lend me yours for a few
days? I will return them next market-day.”</p>

<p>The Worm was so flattered at being noticed by
the Elephant that he gladly consented, and took
his eyes out—which, as every one knows, were very
small—and gave them to the Elephant. When the
Elephant had put the Worm’s eyes into his own
large eye-sockets, the flesh immediately closed round
them so tightly that when the market-day arrived it
was impossible for the Elephant to get them out
again to return to the Worm; and although the
Worm repeatedly made applications to the Elephant
to return his eyes, the Elephant always pretended
not to hear, and sometimes used to say in a
very loud voice, “If there are any Worms about,
they had better get out of my way, as they are so
small I cannot see them, and if I tread on them
they will be squashed.”</p>

<p>Ever since then the Worms have been blind, and
for the same reason Elephants have such small
eyes, quite out of proportion to the size of their
huge bodies!</p>

<h2 id="THE_BOY_WHO_SET_A_SNARE_FOR">THE BOY WHO SET A SNARE FOR
THE SUN</h2>

<p class="author">By H. R. Schoolcraft</p>

<p class="dropcap">At the time when the animals reigned on the
earth, they had killed all the people but a Girl
and her little brother; and these two were living in
fear in an out-of-the-way place. The Boy was a
perfect little pigmy, and never grew beyond the
size of a mere infant; but the Girl increased with
her years, so that the task of providing food and
shelter fell wholly upon her. She went out daily to
get wood for the lodge-fire, and she took her little
brother with her that no mishap might befall them,
for he was too little to leave alone. A big bird of
a mischievous disposition might have flown away
with him. She made him a bow and arrows, and
one day she said to him: “My little brother, I will
leave you behind where I have been gathering the
wood; you must hide yourself, and you will soon
see the snowbirds come and peck the worms out of
the logs which I have piled up. Shoot one of them
and bring it home.”</p>

<p>He obeyed her, and tried his best to kill one, but
he came home unsuccessful. His sister told him
that he must not despair, but try again the next day.</p>

<p>She accordingly left him at the gathering place
of the wood, and returned to the lodge. Toward
nightfall she heard his little footsteps crackling
through the snow, and he hurried in and threw
down, with an air of triumph, one of the birds
which he had killed. “My sister,” said he, “I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
you to skin it, and stretch the skin, and when I
have killed more I will have a coat made out of
them.”</p>

<p>“But what shall we do with the body?” said she;
for they had always up to that time lived upon
greens and berries.</p>

<p>“Cut it in two,” he answered, “and season our
stew with one half of it at a time.”</p>

<p>It was their first dish of game, and they greatly
relished it.</p>

<p>The Boy kept on in his efforts, and in the course
of time he killed ten birds, out of the skins of which
his sister made him a pretty little coat. As he was
small, there was one bird skin to spare.</p>

<p>“Sister,” said he, one day, as he marched up and
down before the lodge, dressed in his new coat and
fancying himself the Greatest Little Fellow in the
World—as he was, for there was no other beside
him—“My sister, are we really alone in the world,
or are we making believe? Is there nobody else
living? And tell me, was all this great broad earth
and this huge big sky made for a little boy and girl
like you and me?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” she said. And then she explained
to him that there were many folks very
unlike a harmless girl and boy, such as they were,
who lived in another part of the earth, and that if
he would live blameless and not endanger his life,
he must never go where they were. This only
served to inflame the Boy’s curiosity, and he soon
took his bow and arrows and went in that direction.
After walking a long while and meeting no
one, he became tired and stretched himself upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
high, green knoll, where the day’s warmth had
melted off the snow.</p>

<p>It was a charming place to lie upon, and he fell
asleep. While he slept the Sun beat so hot upon
him that it singed his bird-skin coat and so shrivelled
and shrunk it upon his body as to wake him up.</p>

<p>When he saw the mischief the Sun’s fiery beams
had played with the coat he was so proud of, he
flew into a great rage and scolded the Sun in a
terrible way for a little boy no higher than a man’s
knee. “Do not think you are too high for me to
get you,” said he; “I shall revenge myself, oh Sun.
I will have you for a plaything yet.”</p>

<p>When he reached home he told his sister how
unfortunate he had been, and bitterly bewailed the
spoiling of his new coat. He would not eat, not so
much as a single berry. He lay down, like one who
fasts, without changing his position for ten days,
nor could his sister persuade him to get up. At
the end of ten days he turned over on the other side
and lay in that position for ten days.</p>

<p>When he got up he was very pale, but very determined.
He ordered his sister to make him a
snare, as he meant to catch the Sun. She said
she had nothing, but presently she brought forward
a deer’s sinew, which their father had left,
and made it into a string suitable for a noose. The
moment she showed it to her brother he said it
would not do, and angrily bade her find something
else. She said she had nothing else, but presently
remembered the bird’s skin that had been left over
when the coat was made, and this she made into a
string. With this the Boy was more vexed than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
over the other. “The Sun has had enough of my
bird skins,” he said; “find something else.”</p>

<p>She did not dare to say again that she had nothing,
so she went out of the lodge murmuring to
herself, “Was there ever so obstinate a boy?”
Luckily she thought of her hair, and pulling out
some of it here and there from among her beautiful
black locks, she quickly braided it into a fine
cord and handed it to her brother.</p>

<p>The moment his eye fell on it he was delighted,
and immediately began to run it back and forth
through his hands, trying its strength. Satisfied
that the long, glossy coil was strong enough, he
wound it around his shoulders and set out from
the lodge a little after midnight, his object being
to catch the Sun before he rose.</p>

<p>Having fixed his snare firmly at a place where
the Sun must strike the land as it rose above the
earth, he waited patiently. The instant it appeared
he drew the cord tight, so that the Sun was
held fast and could not rise.</p>

<p>Soon there was a great commotion among the
animals who ruled the earth. They had no light,
and ran to and fro, calling out to each other and
asking what had happened. They called together
a council to discuss the matter. An old Dormouse,
suspecting what was the trouble, proposed that
some one should be appointed to go out and cut the
cord. This was a bold thing to do, as the rays of
the Sun would surely burn whoever ventured near
them. No one seemed willing to run the risk, so
the Dormouse himself undertook to go. The Dormouse
was, at this time, the largest animal in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
world. When he stood up he looked like a mountain.</p>

<p>He made haste to the place where the Sun lay
ensnared, and as it came nearer and nearer its back
began to smoke and burn with the heat, and the
whole top of its huge body was turned in a very
short time to enormous heaps of ashes. The Dormouse
did succeed, however, in cutting the cord
with its teeth, and the Sun blazed up into the high,
blue sky, as beautiful as ever.</p>

<p>The poor Dormouse paid the price of his bravery.
So great was the heat of the Sun, that he found
himself, when it was all over, shrunk to a little bit
of a thing, and that is the reason why the Dormouse
is one of the tiniest creatures on the earth.</p>

<p>The Little Boy returned home, when he discovered
that the Sun had escaped his snare and devoted
himself entirely to hunting. “If the beautiful hair
of my sister would not hold the Sun fast, nothing in
the world could,” he said. “I was not born, a little
fellow like me, to look after the Sun. It takes some
one greater and wiser than I to do that.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he went out and shot ten more snowbirds,
for at that he was very expert, and had a new
bird-skin coat made, which was prettier than the
one he had worn before.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BIRD_LOVER">THE BIRD LOVER</h2>

<p class="author">By Cornelius Mathews</p>

<p class="dropcap">In a region of country where the forest and the
prairie strived which should be the most beautiful—the
open plain, with its free sunshine and
winds and flowers, or the closed wood, with its
delicious twilight-walks and enamored haunts—there
lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an
old Indian.</p>

<p>Although the country furnished an abundance
of game, and whatever else a good heart could wish
for, it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy
such as fell into his hands. He made use of
all his arts to decoy men into his power, for the
purpose of killing them. The country had been
once thickly peopled, but the Mudjee Monedo had
so thinned it by his cruel practices, that he now
lived almost solitary in the wilderness.</p>

<p>The secret of his success lay in his great speed.
He had the power to assume the shape of any four-footed
creature, and it was his custom to challenge
such as he sought to destroy, to run with him. He
had a beaten path on which he ran, leading around
a large lake, and he always ran around this circle
so that the starting and the winning post was the
same.</p>

<p>Whoever failed, as every one had, yielded up
his life at this post; and although he ran every
day, no man was ever known to beat this evil
genius; for whenever he was pressed hard, he
changed himself into a fox, wolf, deer, or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
swift-footed animal, and was thus able to leave his
competitor behind.</p>

<p>The whole country was in dread of this same
Mudjee Monedo, and yet the young men were constantly
running with him; for if they refused, he
called them cowards, which was a reproach they
could not bear. They would rather die than be
called cowards.</p>

<p>To keep up his sport, the manito made light of
these deadly foot-matches, and instead of assuming
a braggart air, and going about in a boastful
way, with the blood of such as he had overcome
upon his hands, he adopted very pleasing manners,
and visited the lodges around the country as any
other sweet-tempered and harmless old Indian
might.</p>

<p>His secret object in these friendly visits was to
learn whether the young boys were getting old
enough to run with him; he kept a very sharp eye
upon their growth, and the day he thought them
ready, he did not fail to challenge them to a trial
on his racing-ground.</p>

<p>There was not a family in all that beautiful
region which had not in this way been visited and
thinned out; and the manito had quite naturally
come to be held in abhorrence by all the Indian
mothers in the country.</p>

<p>It happened that there lived near him a poor
widow woman, whose husband and seven sons he
had made away with; and she was now living with
an only daughter, and a son of ten or twelve years
old.</p>

<p>This widow was very poor and feeble, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
suffered so much for lack of food and other comforts
of the lodge, that she would have been glad
to die, but for her daughter and her little son. The
Mudjee Monedo had already visited her lodge to
observe whether the boy was sufficiently grown to
be challenged to the race; and so crafty in his approaches
and so soft in his manners was the
Monedo, that the mother feared that he would yet
decoy the son and make away with him as he had
done with his father and his seven brothers, in spite
of all her struggles to save him.</p>

<p>And yet she strove with all her might to
strengthen her son in every good course. She
taught him, as best she could, what was becoming
for the wise hunter and the brave warrior. She
remembered and set before him all that she could
recall of the skill and the craft of his father and his
brothers who were lost.</p>

<p>The widow woman also instructed her daughter
in whatever should make her useful as a wife; and
in the leisure time of the lodge, she gave her lessons
in the art of working with the quills of porcupine,
and bestowed on her such other accomplishments
as should make her an ornament and a blessing
to her husband’s household. The daughter,
Minda by name, was kind and obedient to her
mother, and never failed in her duty. Their lodge
stood high up on the banks of a lake, which gave
them a wide prospect of country, embellished with
groves and open fields, which waved with the blue
light of their long grass, and made, at all hours of
sun and moon, a cheerful scene to look upon.</p>

<p>Across this beautiful prairie, Minda had one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
morning made her way to gather dry limbs for
their fire; for she disdained no labor of the lodge.
And while enjoying the sweetness of the air and
the green beauty of the woods, she strolled far
away.</p>

<p>She had come to a bank, painted with flowers of
every hue, and was reclining on its fragrant couch,
when a bird, of red and deep-blue plumage softly
blended, alighted on a branch near by, and began
to pour forth its carol. It was a bird of strange
character, such as she had never before seen. Its
first note was so delicious to the ear of Minda, and
it so pierced to her young heart, that she listened as
she had never before to any mortal or heavenly
sound. It seemed like the human voice, forbidden
to speak, and uttering its language through this
wild wood-chant with a mournful melody, as if it
bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make
itself more plainly intelligible.</p>

<p>The voice of the bird rose and fell, and circled
round and round, but whithersoever floated or
spread out its notes, they seemed ever to have their
center where Minda sat; and she looked with sad
eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird, that
sat in his red and deep-blue plumage just opposite
to the flowery bank.</p>

<p>The poor bird strove more and more with his
voice, and seemed ever more and more anxiously
to address his notes of lament to Minda’s ears, till
at last she could not refrain from saying: “What
aileth thee, sad bird?”</p>

<p>As if he had but waited to be spoken to, the bird
left his branch, and alighting upon the bank, smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
on Minda, and, shaking his shining plumage, answered:</p>

<p>“I am bound in this condition until a maiden
shall accept me in marriage. I have wandered
these groves and sung to many and many of the
Indian girls, but none ever heeded my voice till
you. Will you be mine?” he added, and poured
forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread
itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene,
and fairly entranced the young Minda, who sat
silent, as if she feared to break the charm by
speech.</p>

<p>The bird, approaching nearer, asked her, if she
loved him, to get her mother’s consent to their marriage.
“I shall be free then,” said the bird, “and
you shall know me as I am.”</p>

<p>Minda lingered and listened to the sweet voice
of the bird in its own forest notes, or filling each
pause with gentle human discourse; questioning
her as to her home, her family, and the little incidents
of her daily life.</p>

<p>She returned to the lodge later than usual, but
she was too timid to speak to her mother of that
which the bird had charged her. She returned
again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood;
and every day she listened to the song and the discourse
of her bird admirer with more pleasure, and
he every day besought her to speak to her mother
of the marriage. This she could not, however,
muster heart and courage to do.</p>

<p>At last the widow began herself to have a suspicion
that her daughter’s heart was in the wood,
from her long delays in returning, and the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
success she had in gathering the fire-branches for
which she went in search.</p>

<p>In answer to her mother’s questions, Minda revealed
the truth, and made known her lover’s request.
The mother, considering the lonely and
destitute condition of her little household, gave her
consent.</p>

<p>The daughter, with light steps, hastened with
the news to the wood. The bird lover of course
heard it with delight, and fluttered through the
air in happy circles, and poured forth a song of joy
which thrilled Minda to the heart.</p>

<p>He said that he would come to the lodge at sunset,
and immediately took wing, while Minda hung
fondly upon his flight, till he was lost far away in
the blue sky.</p>

<p>With the twilight the bird lover, whose name
was Monedowa, appeared at the door of the lodge,
as a hunter, with a red plume and a mantle of blue
upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>He addressed the widow as his friend, and she
directed him to sit down beside her daughter, and
they were regarded as man and wife.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning, he asked for
the bow and arrows of those who had been slain
by the wicked manito, and went out a-hunting. As
soon as he had got out of sight of the lodge, he
changed himself into the wood-bird, as he had been
before his marriage, and took his flight through the
air.</p>

<p>Although game was scarce in the neighborhood
of the widow’s lodge, Monedowa returned at evening,
in his character of a hunter, with two deer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
This was his daily practice, and the widow’s family
never more lacked for food.</p>

<p>It was noticed, however, that Monedowa himself
ate but little, and that of a peculiar kind of
meat, flavored with berries, which, with other circumstances,
convinced them that he was not as the
Indian people around him.</p>

<p>In a few days his mother-in-law told him that
the manito would come to pay them a visit, to see
how the young man, her son, prospered.</p>

<p>Monedowa answered that he should on that day
be absent. When the time arrived, he flew upon a
tall tree, overlooking the lodge, and took his station
there, as the wicked manito passed in.</p>

<p>The Mudjee Monedo cast sharp glances at the
scaffolds so well laden with meat, and as soon as he
had entered, he said, “Why, who is it that is furnishing
you with meat so plentifully?”</p>

<p>“No one,” she answered, “but my son; he is just
beginning to kill deer.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he retorted; “some one is living with
you.”</p>

<p>“Kaween, no indeed,” replied the widow; “you
are only making sport of my hapless condition.
Who do you think would come and trouble themselves
about me?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the manito, “I will go;
but on such a day I will again visit you, and see
who it is that furnishes the meat, and whether it is
your son or not.”</p>

<p>He had no sooner left the lodge and got out of
sight, than the son-in-law made his appearance
with two more deer. On being made acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
with the conduct of the manito, “Very well,” he
said, “I will be at home the next time, to see him.”</p>

<p>Both the mother and the wife urged Monedowa
to be aware of the manito. They made known to
him all of his cruel courses, and assured him that no
man could escape from his power.</p>

<p>“No matter,” said Monedowa; “if he invites me
to the race-ground, I will not be backward. What
follows may teach him, my mother, to show pity
on the vanquished, and not to trample on the
widow and those who are without fathers.”</p>

<p>When the day of the visit of the manito arrived,
Monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces
of meat, which he pointed out to her, together with
two or three buds of the birch-tree, which he requested
her to put in the pot. He directed also
that the manito should be hospitably received, as if
he had been just the kind-hearted old Indian he
professed to be. Monedowa then dressed himself
as a warrior, embellishing his visage with tints of
red, to show that he was prepared for either war or
peace.</p>

<p>As soon as the Mudjee Monedo arrived, he eyed
this strange warrior whom he had never seen before;
but he dissembled, as usual, and, with a gentle
laugh, said to the widow, “Did I not tell you that
some one was staying with you, for I knew your
son was too young to hunt.”</p>

<p>The widow excused herself by saying that she
did not think it necessary to tell him, inasmuch as
he was a manito, and must have known before he
asked.</p>

<p>The manito was very pleasant with Monedowa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
and after much other discourse, in a gentle-spoken
voice, he invited him to the racing-ground, saying
it was a manly amusement, that he would have an
excellent chance to meet there with other warriors,
and that he should himself be pleased to run with
him.</p>

<p>Monedowa would have excused himself, saying
that he knew nothing of running.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied the Mudjee Monedo, trembling
in every limb as he spoke, “don’t you see how old I
look, while you are young and full of life. We
must at least run a little to amuse others.”</p>

<p>“Be it so, then,” replied Monedowa. “I will
oblige you. I will go in the morning.”</p>

<p>Pleased with his crafty success, the manito would
have now taken his leave, but he was pressed to remain
and partake of their hospitality. The meal
was immediately prepared. But one dish was used.</p>

<p>Monedowa partook of it first, to show his guest
that he need not fear, saying at the same time, “It
is a feast, and as we seldom meet, we must eat all
that is placed on the dish, as a mark of gratitude to
the Great Spirit for permitting me to kill animals,
and for the pleasure of seeing you, and partaking
of it with you.”</p>

<p>They ate and talked, on this and that, until they
had nearly dispatched the meal, when the manito
took up the dish and drank off the broth at a breath.
On setting it down he immediately turned his head
and commenced coughing with great violence.
The old body in which he had disguised himself
was well nigh shaken in pieces, for he had, as
Monedowa expected, swallowed a grain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
birch-bud, and this, which relished to himself as
being of the bird nature, greatly distressed the old
manito, who partook of the character of an animal
or four-footed thing.</p>

<p>He was at last put to such confusion of face by
his constant coughing, that he was enforced to
leave, saying, or rather hiccoughing as he left the
lodge, that he should look for the young man at the
racing-ground in the morning.</p>

<p>When the morning came, Monedowa was early
astir, oiling his limbs and enameling his breast and
arms with red and blue, resembling the plumage in
which he had first appeared to Minda. Upon his
brow he placed a tuft of feathers of the same shining
tints.</p>

<p>By his invitation his wife, Minda, the mother and
her young son, attended Monedowa to the manito’s
racing-ground.</p>

<p>The lodge of the manito stood upon a high
ground, and near it stretched out a long row of
other lodges, said to be possessed by wicked kindred
of his, who shared in the spoils of his cruelty.</p>

<p>As soon as the young hunter and his party approached,
the inmates appeared at their lodge-doors
and cried out:</p>

<p>“We are visited.”</p>

<p>At this cry, the Mudjee Monedo came forth and
descended with his companions to the starting-post
on the plain. From this the course could be seen,
winding in a long girdle about the lake; and as
they were now all assembled, the old manito began
to speak of the race, belted himself up and pointed
to the post, which was an upright pillar of stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>“But before we start,” said the manito, “I wish
it to be understood that when men run with me I
make a wager, and I expect them to abide by it—life
against life.”</p>

<p>“Very well—be it so,” answered Monedowa.
“We shall see whose head is to be dashed against
the stone.”</p>

<p>“We shall,” rejoined the Mudjee Monedo. “I
am very old, but I shall try and make a run.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” again rejoined Monedowa; “I hope
we shall both stand to our bargain.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said the old manito; and he at the same
time cast a sly glance at the young hunter, and
rolled his eyes toward where stood the pillar of
stone.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” said Monedowa.</p>

<p>The starting shout was given, and they set off
at high speed, the manito leading, and Monedowa
pressing closely after. As he closed upon him, the
old manito began to show his power, and changing
himself into a fox he passed the young hunter with
ease, and went leisurely along.</p>

<p>Monedowa now, with a glance upward, took the
shape of the strange bird of red and deep-blue
plumage, and with one flight, lighting at some distance
ahead of the manito, resumed his mortal
shape.</p>

<p>When the Mudjee Monedo espied his competitor
before him, “Whoa! whoa!” he exclaimed; “this
is strange;” and he immediately changed himself
into a wolf, and sped past Monedowa.</p>

<p>As he galloped by, Monedowa heard a noise
from his throat, and he knew that he was still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
distress from the birch-bud which he had swallowed
at his mother-in-law’s lodge.</p>

<p>Monedowa again took wing, and, shooting into
the air, he descended suddenly with great swiftness,
and took the path far ahead of the old manito.</p>

<p>As he passed the wolf he whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>“My friend, is this the extent of your speed?”</p>

<p>The manito began to be troubled with bad forebodings,
for, on looking ahead, he saw the young
hunter in his own manly form, running along at
leisure. The Mudjee Monedo, seeing the necessity
of more speed, now passed Monedowa in the shape
of a deer.</p>

<p>They were now far around the circle of the lake,
and fast closing in upon the starting-post, when
Monedowa, putting on his red and blue plumage,
glided along the air and alighted upon the track
far in advance.</p>

<p>To overtake him, the old manito assumed the
shape of a buffalo; and he pushed on with such long
gallops that he was again the foremost on the
course. The buffalo was the last change he could
make, and it was in this form that he had most
frequently conquered.</p>

<p>The young hunter, once more a bird, in the act
of passing the manito, saw his tongue lolling from
his mouth with fatigue.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Monedowa, “is this all your
speed?”</p>

<p>The manito made no answer. Monedowa had
resumed his character of a hunter, and was within
a run of the winning-post, when the wicked manito
had nearly overtaken him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bakah! bakah! nejee!” he called out to Monedowa;
“stop, my friend, I wish to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Monedowa laughed aloud as he replied:</p>

<p>“I will speak to you at the starting-post. When
men run with me I make a wager, and I expect
them to abide by it—life against life.”</p>

<p>One more flight as the blue bird with red wings,
and Monedowa was so near to the goal that he
could easily reach it in his mortal shape. Shining
in beauty, his face lighted up like the sky, with
tinted arms and bosom gleaming in the sun, and the
parti-colored plume on his brow waving in the
wind, Monedowa, cheered by a joyful shout from
his own people, leaped to the post.</p>

<p>The manito came on with fear in his face.</p>

<p>“My friend,” he said, “spare my life;” and then
added, in a low voice, as if he would not that the
others should hear it, “Give me to live.” And he
began to move off as if the request had been
granted.</p>

<p>“As you have done to others,” replied Monedowa,
“so shall it be done to you.”</p>

<p>And seizing the wicked manito, he dashed him
against the pillar of stone. His kindred, who were
looking on in horror, raised a cry of fear and fled
away in a body to some distant land, whence they
have never returned.</p>

<p>The widow’s family left the scene, and when
they had all come out into the open fields, they
walked on together until they had reached the fragrant
bank and the evergreen wood, where the
daughter had first encountered her bird lover.</p>

<p>Monedowa, turning to the widow, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>“My mother, here we must part. Your daughter
and myself must now leave you. The Good Spirit,
moved with pity, has allowed me to be your friend.
I have done that for which I was sent. I am permitted
to take with me the one whom I love. I
have found your daughter ever kind, gentle and
just. She shall be my companion. The blessing
of the Good Spirit be ever with you. Farewell,
my mother—my brother, farewell.”</p>

<p>While the widow woman was still lost in wonder
at these words, Monedowa, and Minda, his wife,
changed at the same moment, rose into the air, as
beautiful birds, clothed in shining colors of red and
blue.</p>

<p>They caroled together as they flew, and their
songs were happy, and falling, falling, like clear
drops. As they rose, and rose, and winged their
way far upward, a delicious peace came into the
mind of the poor widow woman, and she returned
to her lodge deeply thankful at heart for all the
goodness that had been shown to her by the Master
of Life.</p>

<p>From that day forth she never knew want, and
her young son proved a comfort to her lodge, and
the tuneful carol of Monedowa and Minda, as it
fell from heaven, was a music always, go whither
she would, sounding peace and joy in her ear.</p>

<h2 id="WUNZH_THE_FATHER_OF_INDIAN">WUNZH, THE FATHER OF INDIAN
CORN</h2>

<p class="author">By Cornelius Mathews</p>

<p class="dropcap">In time past—we cannot tell exactly how many,
many years ago—a poor Indian was living,
with his wife and children, in a beautiful part of
the country. He was not only poor, but he was
not expert in procuring food for his family, and his
children were too young to give him assistance.</p>

<p>Although of a lowly condition and straitened in
his circumstances, he was a man of kind and contented
disposition. He was always thankful to
the Great Spirit for everything he received. He
even stood in the door of his lodge to bless the birds
that flew past in the summer evenings; although,
if he had been of a complaining temper, he might
have repined that they were not rather spread upon
the table for his evening meal.</p>

<p>The same generous and sweet disposition was
inherited by his eldest son, who had now arrived
at the proper age to undertake the ceremony of the
fast, to learn what kind of a spirit would be his
guide and guardian through life.</p>

<p>Wunzh, for this was his name, had been an
obedient boy from his infancy—pensive, thoughtful,
and gentle—so that he was beloved by the
whole family.</p>

<p>As soon as the first buds of spring appeared, and
the delicious fragrance of the young year began to
sweeten the air, his father, with the help of his
younger brothers, built for Wunzh the customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
little lodge, at a retired spot at some distance from
their own, where he would not be disturbed during
the solemn rite.</p>

<p>To prepare himself, Wunzh sought to clear
his heart of every evil thought, and to think of
nothing that was not good, and beautiful, and
kindly.</p>

<p>That he might store his mind with pleasant ideas
for his dreams, for the first few days he amused
himself by walking in the woods and over the
mountains, examining the early plants and flowers.</p>

<p>As he rambled far and wide, through the wild
country, he felt a strong desire to know how the
plants and herbs and berries grew, without any
aid from man, and why it was that some kinds
were good to eat, and that others were possessed of
medicinal or poisonous power.</p>

<p>After he had become too languid to walk about,
and confined himself strictly to the lodge, he recalled
these thoughts, and turning them in his
mind, he wished he could dream of something that
would prove a benefit to his father and family, and
to all others of his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>“True,” thought Wunzh, “the Great Spirit made
all things, and it is to him that we owe our lives.
Could he not make it easier for us to get our food,
than by hunting animals and taking fish? I must
try to find this out in my visions.”</p>

<p>On the third day Wunzh became weak and faint
and kept to his bed. Suddenly he fancied, as he
lay thus, that a bright light came in at the lodge
door, and ere he was aware, he saw a handsome
young man, with a complexion of the softest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
purest white, coming down from the sky, and advancing
toward him.</p>

<p>The beautiful stranger was richly and gayly
dressed, having on a great many garments of
green and yellow colors, but differing in their
deeper or lighter shades. He had a plume of waving
feathers on his head, and all his motions were
graceful, and reminded Wunzh of the deep green
of the summer grass, and the clear amber of the
summer sky, and the gentle blowing of the summer
wind. Beautiful as the stranger was, he paused on
a little mound of earth, just before the door of the
lodge.</p>

<p>“I am sent to you, my friend,” said his celestial
visitor, in a voice most soft and musical to listen to,
“I am sent to you by that Great Spirit who made
all things in the sky, and on the earth. He has
seen and knows your motives in fasting. He sees
that it is from a kind and benevolent wish to do
good to your people, and to procure a benefit for
them; that you do not seek for strength in war, or
the praise of the men of the bloody hand. I am
sent to instruct you and to show you how you can
do your kindred good.”</p>

<p>He then told the young man to arise, and to
prepare to wrestle with him, as it was only by
this means that he could hope to succeed in his
wishes.</p>

<p>Wunzh knew how weak he was from fasting, but
the voice of the stranger was cheery, and put such
a courage in his heart, that he promptly sprang up,
determined to die rather than fail. Brave Wunzh!
if you ever accomplish anything, it will be through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
the power of the resolve that spake within you at
that moment.</p>

<p>He began the trial, and after a long-sustained
struggle he was almost overpowered, when the
beautiful stranger said:</p>

<p>“My friend, it is enough for once, I will come
again to try you”; and smiling on him, he returned
through the air in the same direction in which he
had come.</p>

<p>The next day, although he saw how sweetly the
wild-flowers bloomed upon the slopes, and the birds
warbled from the woodland, he longed to see the
celestial visitor, and to hear his voice.</p>

<p>To his great joy he reappeared at the same hour,
toward the going down of the sun, and re-challenged
Wunzh to a trial of strength.</p>

<p>The brave Wunzh felt that his strength of body
was even less than on the day before, but the courage
of his mind seemed to grow. Observing this,
and how Wunzh put his whole heart in the struggle,
the stranger again spoke to him in the words he
used before, adding:</p>

<p>“To-morrow will be your last trial. Be strong,
my friend, for this is the only way in which you can
overcome me and obtain the boon you seek.”</p>

<p>The light which shone after him as he left
Wunzh was brighter than before.</p>

<p>On the third day he came again and renewed the
struggle. Very faint in body was poor Wunzh,
but he was stronger at heart than ever, and determined
to prevail now or perish.</p>

<p>He put forth his utmost powers, and after a
contest more severe than either of the others, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
stranger ceased his efforts, and declared himself
conquered.</p>

<p>For the first time he entered Wunzh’s little fasting
lodge, and sitting down beside the youth, he
began to deliver his instructions to inform him in
what manner he should proceed to take advantage
of his victory.</p>

<p>“You have won your desire of the Great Spirit,”
said the beautiful stranger. “You have wrestled
manfully. To-morrow will be the seventh day of
your fasting. Your father will give you food to
strengthen you, and as it is the last day of trial
you will prevail. I know this, and now tell
you what you must do to benefit your family and
your people. To-morrow,” he repeated, “I shall
meet you and wrestle with you for the last time. As
soon as you have prevailed against me, you will
strip off my garments and throw me down, clean
the earth of roots and weeds, make it soft, and
bury me in the spot. When you have done this,
leave my body in the earth, and do not disturb it,
but come at times to visit the place, to see whether
I have come to life, and above all be careful to
never let the grass or weeds grow upon my grave.
Once a month cover me with fresh earth. If you
follow these my instructions you will accomplish
your object of doing good to your fellow-creatures
by teaching them the knowledge I now teach you.”</p>

<p>He then shook Wunzh by the hand and disappeared,
but he was gone so soon that Wunzh could
not tell what direction he took.</p>

<p>In the morning, Wunzh’s father came to his
lodge with some slight refreshments, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>“My son, you have fasted long enough. If the
Great Spirit will favor you, he will do it now. It
is seven days since you have tasted food, and you
must not sacrifice your life. The Master of Life
does not require that.”</p>

<p>“My father,” replied Wunzh, “wait till the sun
goes down. I have a particular reason for extending
my fast to that hour.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the old man, “I shall wait
till the hour arrives, and you shall be inclined to
eat.”</p>

<p>At his usual hour of appearing, the beautiful
sky-visitor returned, and the trial of strength was
renewed. Although he had not availed himself of
his father’s offer of food, Wunzh felt that new
strength had been given him. His heart was
mighty within him to achieve some great purpose.
Courage was like the eagle that spreads his wings
within the treetop for a great flight, within the
bosom of the brave Wunzh.</p>

<p>He grasped his angel challenger with supernatural
strength, threw him down, and, mindful of
his own instructions, tore from him his beautiful
garments and plume, and finding him dead, immediately
buried him on the spot, using all the precautions
he had been told of, and very confident
was Wunzh, all the time, that his friend would
again come to life.</p>

<p>Wunzh now returned to his father’s lodge, where
he was warmly welcomed, for as it had been appointed
to him during the days of his fasting to
walk apart with Heaven, he was not permitted to
see any human face save that of his father, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
representative to the little household upon earth of the
Good Father who is in Heaven.</p>

<p>Wunzh partook sparingly of the meal that had
been prepared for him, and once more mingled in
the cares and sports of the family. But he never
for a moment forgot the grave of his friend. He
carefully visited it throughout the spring, and
weeded out the grass, and kept the ground in a
soft and pliant state; and sometimes, when the
brave Wunzh thought of his friend that was gone
from his sight, he dropped a tear upon the earth
where he lay.</p>

<p>Watching and tending, and moistening the earth
with his tears, it was not long before Wunzh saw
the tops of green plumes coming through the
ground; and the more faithful he was in obeying
his instructions in keeping the ground in order, and
in cherishing the memory of his departed friend,
the faster they grew. He was, however, careful to
conceal the charge of the earth which he had from
his father.</p>

<p>Days and weeks had passed in this way; the summer
was drawing toward a close, when one day,
after a long absence in hunting, Wunzh invited his
father to follow him to the quiet and lonesome spot
of his former fast.</p>

<p>The little fasting-lodge had been removed, and
the weeds kept from growing on the circle where it
had stood; but in its place rose a tall and graceful
plant, surmounted with nodding plumes and stately
leaves, and golden clusters.</p>

<p>There was in its aspect and bearing the deep
green of the summer grass, the clear amber of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
the summer sky, and the gentle blowing of the
summer wind.</p>

<p>“It is my friend!” shouted Wunzh, “it is the
friend of all mankind. It is Mondawmin; it is our
Indian Corn! We need no longer rely on hunting
alone, for as long as this gift is cherished and taken
care of, the ground itself will give us a living.”</p>

<p>He then pulled an ear.</p>

<p>“See, my father,” said he, “this is what I fasted
for. The Great Spirit has listened to my voice,
and sent us something new, and henceforth our
people will not alone depend upon the chase or
upon the waters.”</p>

<p>Wunzh then communicated to his father the instructions
given to him by the stranger. He told
him that the broad husks must be torn away, as he
had pulled off the garments in his wrestling, and
having done this, he directed him how the ear must
be held before the fire till the outer skin became
brown—as the complexion of his angel friend had
been tinted by the sun—while all the milk was retained
in the grain.</p>

<p>The whole family, in high spirits, and deeply
grateful to the Merciful Master who gave it, assisted
in a feast on the newly-grown ears of corn.</p>

<p>So came that mighty blessing into the world, and
we owe all of those beautiful fields of healthful
grain to the dream of the brave boy Wunzh.</p>

<h2 id="WHEN_BRER_WOLF_HAVE_HIS_CORN">WHEN BRER WOLF HAVE HIS CORN
SHUCKING</h2>

<p class="author">Anonymous</p>

<p class="dropcap">Brer Wolf he make a powerful crop of
corn one year, and he turn it over in his
mind how he going to get all that corn shucked,
’cause Brer Wolf mighty unpopular man with his
neighbors, and when Brer Wolf have a corn shucking
the creeters don’t turn out like they do when
Sis Coon have a corn shucking.</p>

<p>But Brer Wolf he have a powerful handsome
daughter on the carpet. All the chaps about the
county has had their heads set to step up to Brer
Wolf’s daughter. So Brer Wolf he send out word
how the chap what shucks the most corn at his
shucking shall have his handsome daughter.</p>

<p>Well, the chaps they come from the fur end of
Columbia County, and some come from Richmond
County, and they set to work, and they make the
shucks fly, and each chap have a pile to hisself.
Brer Coon he mighty set on Brer Wolf’s daughter,
and Brer Coon he know hisself are powerful likely
corn shucker, and Brer Coon he ’low to hisself how
he have a right smart chance to get the gal.</p>

<p>Brer Fox his head done plain turned when Miss
Wolf role her handsome eyes at hisself; and so
Brer Fox he get a pile to hisself and fall to
work.</p>

<p>Now old Brer Rabbit his heart set on the gal,
but Brer Rabbit he are a mighty poor corn shucker.
Brer Rabbit he just naterally know he don’t stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
no chance shucking a pile of corn and making time
against Brer Coon.</p>

<p>So Brer Rabbit he don’t waste hisself, Brer
Rabbit don’t, but he take his hat off and he go up
to Brer Wolf, and he make his bow, and he ask
Brer Wolf, if he learn his daughter to dance, can
he have her? But Brer Wolf he say, “What I
said, I said.”</p>

<p>Well, Brer Rabbit he feel terrible put down, but
he fall to, and he act most survigorous. He sing
and he dance, and he dance and he sing, and he
amuse the company most ’greeable like; and he
sing before the gals, and he dance before the gals,
and he show them the new step and the new shuffle,
Brer Rabbit do. Brer Coon he just turn his eye on
Brer Rabbit ’casionally, but he don’t pay no attention
to his acting and his frolicking. Brer Coon he
just make time with his corn shucking, twell Brer
Coon’s pile it make three times the pile of the other
chaps.</p>

<p>When it come time for Brer Wolf to come
round and count his piles, Brer Rabbit he set down
’long side Brer Coon, and he fall to shucking corn
to beat all. When Brer Wolf come ’round, Brer
Rabbit he certainly do make the shucks fly powerful
’cause the old rascal just been cutting up and
acting all the evening, and he ain’t tired like the
other chaps.</p>

<p>When Brer Wolf see the great pile so much
bigger than what all the other chaps got, Brer
Wolf he say, “What for both you chaps shuck on
one pile?” Brer Coon he ’low that all his pile.
He ’low, Brer Coon do, how Brer Rabbit been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
cutting up and frolicking all the evening, and he
just now come and set down ’longside his pile.</p>

<p>Brer Rabbit he say he swear and kiss the book,
this my pile. Brer Coon he just been frolicking
and going on all the evening to beat all; he make
us laugh nigh ’bout fit to kill ourselves while I
done work my hands plum to the bone. Now he set
hisself down here and say it his pile.</p>

<p>Brer Wolf he say he leave it to the company.
But the chaps they don’t want Brer Rabbit to have
the gal, and they don’t want Brer Coon to have
the gal, so they won’t take sides; they ’low they
been working so powerful hard, they don’t take
noticement of Brer Coon or Brer Rabbit. Then
Brer Wolf he ’low he leave it to the gals.</p>

<p>Now Miss Wolf she been favoring Brer Rabbit
all the evening. Brer Rabbit dancing and singing
plum turned Miss Wolf’s head, so Miss Wolf she
say, “It most surely are Brer Rabbit’s pile.” Miss
Wolf she say she “plum ’stonished how Brer Coon
can story so.”</p>

<p>Brer Rabbit he take the gal and go off home
clipity, lipity. Poor old Brer Coon he take hisself
off home, he so tired he can scarcely hold hisself
together.</p>

<h2 id="THE_FOUR_SEASONS">THE FOUR SEASONS</h2>

<p class="author">By Lillian M. Gask</p>

<p class="dropcap">There was not a prettier cottage on the borders
of the forest than that which was the
home of Clare and Laura. A beautiful rose-tree
clambered all over the little house, thrusting its
clusters of small pink blossoms through the open
windows, and nodding to Clare as though to say:
“You are as sweet as we are, and the sun shines
on us all.”</p>

<p>The roses did not nod their heads at Laura, for
she was as ugly and wicked as Clare was lovely.
Her face wore always a heavy frown, which her
mother’s reflected; for Laura was her favorite
child, and she could not bear to see that her second
daughter, for whom she had no spark of love,
should be so much the more attractive of the two.</p>

<p>Dame Nature had been very kind to the little
Clare. The roses had given their delicate coloring
to her soft cheeks, and her pretty eyes were just the
hue of a purple pansy. The red of the crimson
berries that glinted among the evergreens when
winter came was not more vivid than that of her
lips, and her hair had the sheen of yellow corn when
the sun is smiling on it. Laura could not look at
her without a pang of envy, and longed to drive
her away from home.</p>

<p>One bitter day in winter, when a waste of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
surrounded the cottage, and frozen icicles hung
from the roof, Laura asked her mother if Clare
might pick some violets in the woods for her.</p>

<p>“‘Violets?’” exclaimed the mother, “at this time
of the year? Why, you must be dreaming, child!
There is not a single flower in all the forest!”</p>

<p>But Laura insisted that Clare should be sent to
seek for the flowers, and, loath to refuse her anything,
her mother did as she was asked.</p>

<p>“Do not come back without them, or it will be
the worse for you,” Laura called from the doorway,
as she watched her little sister go shiveringly down
the pathway that led to the forest. In its depths,
she knew, there lurked gaunt gray wolves, and
these were fierce with hunger.</p>

<p>Clare knew this too, and her heart was faint with
fear as she passed through the grove of fir-trees.
A cheery little robin hopped down from one of the
branches, and sang a few bars of his winter song as
if to comfort her; she had gone but a few paces
further when she saw the red of his breast repeated
in a glimmer of ruddy light in the distance. She
hastened towards it, and found it came from a huge
fire, round which were sitting twelve strange men.
The faces of all were kindly, but while three had
long white beards and snowy garments, three had
golden beards and long green garments, three had
auburn beards and yellow garments, and yet another
triplet, with long black beards, were dressed
in violet. One of the three whose hair was frosted
looked up as she approached.</p>

<p>“May I warm myself at the fire, kind sir?” she
asked him timidly, and making room for her at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
once, he asked her why she wandered in the forest
in such bitter weather.</p>

<p>“I was sent to pluck violets for my sister,” Clare
explained, “and I dare not go home without them,
or she would be very angry.”</p>

<p>At this her questioner turned to one of the three
men who were robed in purple.</p>

<p>“Violets are your concern, Brother May. Cannot
you help the poor little thing?” he asked. “She
will be frozen to death otherwise, for to-night ’twill
be colder than ever.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” said Brother May, laying a
gentle hand on Clare’s fair hair; and taking the
staff from the white-haired man, he poked the fire.</p>

<p>This was the signal for a most marvellous change
in the forest. Ice and snow disappeared, and the
air became soft and balmy. Birds sang in the
branches overhead, and flowers sprang up as if by
magic round the path which Clare had trodden.
She filled her hands with fragrant violets, and
thanked the brothers for their help.</p>

<p>“You are welcome, dear child,” they cried; and
the old man took back his staff again, and in his
turn poked the fire. Once more it was winter,
and Clare hastened home to the cottage as quickly
as she could.</p>

<p>Both Laura and her mother were surprised to
see her, for they had made sure that she would
lose her way. Laura snatched at the violets, only
to toss them aside, and was so unkind for the rest
of the day that Clare sobbed herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning she was again sent out in the
snow. This time it was to seek wild strawberries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
in the forest, and her sister’s look was so full of
meaning as she said, “Do not come home without
them!” that the poor little maiden trembled with
fear as well as with cold as she entered the gloomy
wood. The same friendly robin fluttered across
her path, and following the direction in which he
flew, to her great delight she saw again the ruddy
glow of the fire. The twelve strange men were
still seated round it, and Brother January took her
by the hand.</p>

<p>“Why are you here again, poor child?” he asked
her gently. “It would surely be wiser for you to
stay at home while King Frost reigns over the
land, for you are young and tender, and his grip
is very cruel.”</p>

<p>“I had to come, sir,” Clare explained. “My
sister said she must have strawberries. We gathered
some in June last year.”</p>

<p>Brother January turned to a companion dressed
in flowing yellow.</p>

<p>“Strawberries are your concern, Brother June,”
he said. “It is for you now to come to the aid of
our little friend.”</p>

<p>“I will do so with pleasure,” said Brother June,
taking the staff held out to him, and giving the fire
a vigorous poke. At this, the winter disappeared,
the trees sprang into full leaf, and crimson berries
were seen amidst the creeping tendrils of the strawberry
plant.</p>

<p>Clare gathered as much of the sweet fruit as
she could carry, and once more thanked her friends
with a grateful smile.</p>

<p>“You are welcome,” they cried in chorus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
as Brother January took back his staff the winter
once more spread its mantle over the earth.</p>

<p>Instead of being grateful for the delicious fruit
that Clare had brought her, Laura was more vexed
than ever to find she had not been eaten by wolves.
Her mother, too, looked at the poor girl angrily,
and sent her out to the barn, as if she could no
longer bear the sight of her.</p>

<p>Clare was barely awake next morning when she
was told that she must go to the forest and bring
home some apples for her sister Laura, who had a
fancy for them.</p>

<p>“But it’s so dark, dear mother,” cried Clare in
terror.</p>

<p>“Make haste and go,” was the only answer, and
as quickly as her numbed fingers would allow her,
Clare finished her simple toilet and started on her
way.</p>

<p>The robin was still asleep with his head tucked
under his wing, but a tiny wood-mouse poked
out his head from his nest in the foot of a hollow
tree, as he heard her footsteps upon the frozen
snow.</p>

<p>“If you walk straight on, you will find your
friends,” he squeaked, and Clare thankfully followed
his directions. Before long she was warming
herself before the glowing fire, and the brothers
were asking with much sympathy why she had again
been sent to face the cold.</p>

<p>“‘Apples’!” cried Brother January, when she
had told them. “Ah! it’s your concern now, Brother
September.”</p>

<p>Forthwith September poked the fire, and lo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
behold! it was cheery autumn, and the ground was
strewn with crimson and russet leaves. A tree of
wild apples close beside her was laden with fruit.</p>

<p>Brother September turned to the child with a
kindly smile. “Gather two of them,” he said.
Clare picked two of the largest and finest, and
when she had done so, September handed back his
staff to January; he stirred the fire, and ice and
snow reappeared.</p>

<p>Laura made no effort to disguise her disappointment
when Clare brought her the two apples. She
ate them, however, and finding their flavor most
delicious, commanded her to fetch her hood and
cloak. In spite of all that her mother could say
to dissuade her, she declared that she would go
to the forest and gather some for herself.</p>

<p>“I shall find much finer ones than those you
brought me, you greedy creature!” she said to
Clare as she flounced away, refusing her gentle
offer to go with her.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly on the sparkling snow,
and she took the same path that her sister had
done. The robin glanced at her from his bright
dark eyes, but he did not attempt to sing. He was
frightened by something he saw in her face; it was
the spirit of greed and envy.</p>

<p>After wandering about for some time, and, to
her great disgust, finding nothing whatever in the
way of fruit, Laura at last caught sight of the fire,
with the twelve little men sitting round. Without
a word of greeting, she pushed her way into their
midst, and held out her hands towards the glowing
embers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Brother January,
somewhat nettled by her rude manners.</p>

<p>“Nothing from you!” she answered roughly,
scowling as she spoke. The old man poked the fire
in silence, and the sky grew dark; a heavy snow
storm began to fall, and Laura tried in vain to
make her way home again, for the great flakes,
dropping silently one on another, made the path
she had come by impossible to tread. She stumbled
at last into a great drift, and soon was buried
in its depths.</p>

<p>Her mother grew more and more anxious about
her as the day wore on, and when afternoon came
set out to seek her in the forest. She also found
her way to the glowing fire, and pushing aside
Brother January just as her daughter had done,
proceeded to warm her hands. When asked what
she wanted, she gave the same rude answer, with
the same result. The old man poked the fire, and
the snow fell swiftly and silently. Very soon she
too was buried in a glistening bank, and Clare had
neither mother nor sister left.</p>

<p>With all their faults she had loved them fondly,
and it would have been lonely for her in the cottage
now, if it had not been for her friends of the forest.
As each month of the year came round, one paid
her a visit, bringing flowers or fruit, or glorious
crimson leaves. The white-bearded men alone
came empty-handed, but these sat with her beside
the fire, and told her wonderful stories of winter
in many lands. In the course of time she became
a good and beautiful woman, and wedded a prince
from a distant shore.</p>

<h2 id="THE_THREE_LEMONS">THE THREE LEMONS</h2>

<p class="author">By Lillian M. Gask</p>

<p class="dropcap">A certain Sultan had a son of whom he
was justly proud, for the young man was
handsome and gay of temper, and had never been
known to do an unworthy action. In the circle
of the court he was the brightest star, and very
sweet were the glances thrown him by the high-born
ladies who served the Sultan. The Prince
was courteous to them all, but he favored no one,
and as years went on, and he showed no signs of
taking to himself a wife, the Sultan became disturbed.</p>

<p>“My son,” he said, “why do you not choose a
bride? It is time you were married, for I should
like to see you the father of children before I go
to my rest. Surely it would be easy to find a mate
amidst these fair women you see around you? I
should experience no difficulty were I in your
place.”</p>

<p>The young Prince looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I must have something more than any of them
can give me, my father,” he replied, “and if you
really wish me to take a wife, I will go on a long
journey, perhaps even round the world, and seek a
princess whom I can love. She must be fair as the
morning, white as the snow, and as pure as an
angel.”</p>

<p>“Well said, my son,” replied the Sultan. “I wish
you good fortune and a safe return.” And without
more ado the Prince departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>The air was crisp with frost, and the glittering
crystals of the snow threw back the radiance of the
sunlight from bank to meadow. The waves that
tossed and tumbled on the distant shore seemed
to beckon him towards them, so he hastened to
the coast, where he found a splendid vessel resting
at anchor. While he was yet wondering how it
had come there, and whither it was bound, invisible
hands drew him on board, and as his feet touched
the deck, the anchor lifted, and the ship set sail.</p>

<p>For three days and three nights it glided swiftly
over the sea, steered by a shadowy pilot who spoke
no word. On the morning of the fourth day it
came to a stop beside a little islet, and the Prince
was amazed to see his favorite horse issue from
the hold, ready saddled and bridled. Concluding
that he was expected to land, he led the horse on
shore, and when he turned round to take another
look at the ship, it had completely vanished.</p>

<p>No sign of any habitation was to be seen, and the
cold was so intense that he could scarcely hold the
reins. In spite of this, he rode on and on, till at
last he reached a small white house that stood by
itself on the top of a hill, unsheltered from the
wind. He knocked at the door with eager haste,
hoping for the glimpse of a fire, and perhaps some
food. His summons was answered by a venerable
woman with scanty hair like wisps of snow,
who stared at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I seek a wife, good mother,” said the Prince.
“She must be the most beautiful princess in the
world, and as good as she is beautiful. Can you
tell me where to find her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>The old woman half shut the door. “You will
not find her here,” she said, “for I am Winter, and
this is my kingdom. My sister Autumn perhaps
may help you, but I have no time for thoughts of
love. You will find her if you go straight on.”</p>

<p>The Prince thanked the old lady, and remounted
his horse hoping that Autumn would at least give
him rest and refreshment. After a while he found
that the snow had disappeared, and that luscious
fruit now hung in clusters from the trees. The
stubble of the corn tinted the fields with gold, and
the squirrels were busily engaged in storing nuts
for the winter. A little further on he came to a
small brown house beside a wood, and, again dismounting,
he knocked at the door. It was opened
by a woman with abundant dark hair and eyes like
sloes. Her cheeks were ruddy, and her look was
kind; she did not, however, ask him in.</p>

<p>“What are you seeking, young man?” she inquired
in a gentle voice.</p>

<p>“I seek a wife,” he answered briefly.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she exclaimed, “then I cannot help you.
My name is Autumn, and I am far too busy gathering
fruit to have time to spare for such things
as love and marriage. My sister Summer is full
of dreams, and she may find you what you want.”</p>

<p>So saying, she shut the door, and as there was
nothing else for him to do, the Prince resumed
his journey.</p>

<p>He noticed ere long that the grass by the roadside
was very tall, and that the fields were heavy
with corn ready for harvest. The air was so warm
that it touched his cheek caressingly, and the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
shone down so hotly that he was fain to unloose
his coat. He was very glad when at last he saw
a small yellow house shaded by a group of trees.
As he knocked at the door, he heard the sound of
a distant waterfall, and the hope of quenching his
thirst was more in his mind just then than the
fairest wife in Summer’s kingdom. His summons
was answered by a stately woman crowned with
auburn tresses.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I cannot help you,” she said, when
he had told her the object of his journey, “for I too
am very busy. Hasten you to my sister Spring;
she is the friend of lovers, and will surely aid you.”</p>

<p>So the Prince went on till he saw a little green
house in a bower of lilac. Hyacinths and violets,
jonquils, narcissi, and fragrant lilies-of-the-valley
bloomed beneath the windows, and when he
knocked at the door, a little lady with flaxen
hair, and eyes of soft deep violet, appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Won’t you take pity on me?” he asked her
eagerly. “Your sisters sent me on to you. I
seek a wife, who must be fair as the morning,
white as the snow, and pure as an angel from
Heaven.”</p>

<p>“You ask a great deal,” Spring told him, smilingly,
“but I will do my best for you. Come in
and rest—you must be tired and hungry.” And
to his great delight she ushered him into a long,
low room, filled with the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>When he had feasted on bread and honey, and
quenched his thirst with sweet new milk, she
brought him three fine lemons on a crystal tray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
Beside them was a handsome silver knife, and a
quaint gold cup of rare design.</p>

<p>“These are magic gifts,” she said, “so guard
them carefully. Return at once to your own home,
and make your way to the great fountains in the
palace gardens. Having made quite sure that you
are alone, take your silver knife and cut open the
first lemon. As you do so, a lovely princess will
instantly appear, and will ask you to give her
water. If you at once offer her some in this golden
cup, she will stay with you and be your wife, but
should you hesitate, even for the space of a second,
she will vanish into thin air, and you will never see
her again.”</p>

<p>“I am not likely to be so foolish,” said the Prince,
“but if I do, shall I have no wife at all?”</p>

<p>“You must then cut open the second lemon,”
Spring answered gravely, “and exactly the same
thing will occur. If you hesitate this time also,
and she too disappears, you will have one more
chance with the third lemon. Should your wits
fail you a third time, you will die without a mate.”</p>

<p>The Prince would have thanked her for her
kindness, but she waved him away with a smile and
a sigh, telling him not to delay. Full of joyful anticipation,
he rode once more through the kingdoms
of Summer, Autumn, and Winter, and when he
arrived at the coast found the same stately vessel
awaiting his pleasure. The wind was favorable
on his homeward voyage, and in a very short time
he had once more gained the precincts of his
father’s palace. Giving his horse into the care of a
groom, he hurried into the great gardens, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
he had filled Spring’s gold cup with water from the
splashing fountains, cut open the first lemon. He
had no sooner done so than a most exquisite Princess
appeared before him, and with a timid glance
asked him to give her water.</p>

<p>“I am thirsty,” she murmured. “Will you not
let me drink from your golden cup?”</p>

<p>The Prince was so lost in admiration that he
could only gaze at her, and with a gesture of reproach
the lovely maiden vanished. It was in vain
that he lamented his stupidity. Do as he would,
he could not call her back again, and with many
regrets he cut the rind of the second lemon. Once
more the gleaming spray of the dancing fountains
took the form of a beautiful girl.</p>

<p>“Fair as the morning and white as snow!” cried
the Prince in rapture, too delighted to heed her
request for a cup of water. He did not regain his
senses until she also had disappeared, when he
again bewailed his neglect of Spring’s injunctions.
With trembling fingers he inserted the silver knife
into the third lemon, and as the pungent odor of
the golden fruit escaped into the air another Princess
appeared before him. Closing his eyes, lest
they might be dazzled by her exceeding beauty, he
immediately offered the golden cup. The maiden
raised it to her lips with a bewitching smile, and
drained it to its dregs. The Prince laughed aloud
for joy; now at last he had found the bride he
sought.</p>

<p>No summer morning was fairer than she, for the
whiteness of snow gleamed on chin and brow, and
her expression was pure and gentle as an angel’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
Drawing her down beside him on to a flowery bank,
he held her hand and looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you be my wife?” he whispered, and to his
delight she answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p>When his first raptures were over, he noticed,
with some disappointment, the simplicity of his
bride’s gown. It was of some simple stuff the
color of running water, and hung in long flowing
folds round her lissom form. No necklace broke
the outline of her dainty throat, and she looked so
different from the maidens of the court that the
Prince, who, after all, was only a man, and not,
perhaps, a very wise one, felt that something was
lacking to complete her beauty.</p>

<p>“Your robe is not worthy of you, dear love,” he
cried. “If you wait for me here, I will fetch you
one of rich white satin from my father’s palace, and
a rope of pearls to twine around your neck.”</p>

<p>But the Princess knew that she needed no ornaments
to enhance her beauty, and she did not wish
him to leave her. Her lover, however, was so insistent
that she consented to stay by the fountains
while he went home, and, more in love with her
than ever, he hurried away.</p>

<p>Now the Princess was very timid, and as the
Prince tarried long she grew frightened of being
alone. So she stretched out her arms to a tree
above her, and swung herself up that she might
nestle amidst its branches. The foliage hid her
slender limbs in their flowing draperies, but her
exquisite face gleamed like a flower from a setting
of glossy leaves, and was mirrored in the deep
basin of the fountains. An ugly negress who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
came to fill her pitcher caught sight of its loveliness,
and, since she had never gazed into a mirror
believed it to be her own.</p>

<p>“Oh, how very handsome I am!” she murmured.
“I am far too beautiful to do the bidding of any
mistress. I will never draw water again.” And
flinging the pitcher from her, she strutted home
with the air of a peacock.</p>

<p>“Why have you come back empty-handed,
Deborah?” inquired her mistress.</p>

<p>“I have seen my face in the fountain,” was the
reply, “and I am much too lovely to fetch and carry
like a poor slave.”</p>

<p>“Why, you are as ugly as sin!” her mistress retorted
sharply. “Go back at once, and do as you
are told.”</p>

<p>Deborah fetched another pitcher and went back
to the fountains, grumbling the while. Again she
caught sight of the Princess’s face reflected in the
water, and again her swarthy features became distorted
with pride.</p>

<p>“It is true!” she cried. “I am lovely as a dream.
I will marry a prince, and live in a palace.” With
this she threw down the second pitcher, and
flounced into her mistress’s presence with such an
assumption of dignity that that lady burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“If you only knew how ugly you are,” she cried,
when she could speak, “you would never talk such
ridiculous nonsense.” And daring her to return
again without the water, she handed the mortified
woman a third pitcher, and sent her back to the
fountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>The flower-like face of the fair Princess smiled
back at the angry negress as she bent over the
pool, and the poor creature grinned and ogled.</p>

<p>“But I am handsome,” she cried triumphantly.
“As handsome as a queen.”</p>

<p>She spoke so loudly that the Princess heard her,
and her laugh rang out like a peal of bells. Looking
hastily up, the negress saw her in the branches,
and disappointed vanity rendered her almost
speechless.… Her mistress was right then,
after all, and the lovely vision she had seen in the
water was not the reflection of herself. As she
stared upward with dilated eyes, there came to her
thoughts of revenge.</p>

<p>“I will make her suffer for this,” she murmured,
but wreathing her wide lips in a false smile, she
bade the Princess “Good-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why do you hide in a tree, lovely lady?” she
asked her gently.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for my Prince, who has gone to
fetch me a satin robe, and a rope of pearls to twine
round my neck,” answered the Princess shyly.</p>

<p>“Your golden hair has been tossed by the wind,”
remarked the negress. “Let me come up beside
you, and I will make it smooth. It will not do to
look untidy when your Prince arrives!”</p>

<p>“How kind you are!” said the Princess, and as
she bent her silken head towards the negress, the
treacherous woman stabbed it with a long sharp pin.</p>

<p>The Princess fell back, faint with pain, but before
her body could touch the ground she turned
into a snow-white pigeon, and flew off uttering
plaintive cries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>The negress took her place in the tree, and when
at last the Prince appeared, bearing a satin robe
and a bridal veil, it was she whom he saw looking
down on him.</p>

<p>“Where is my sweet Princess?” he asked. “She
is fair as the morning, and white as snow. What
have you done with her?”</p>

<p>“Alas! dear Prince,” answered the negress sadly,
“while you were away an enchantress came and
changed me into my present form. When you
have proved your love by making me your wife, I
shall, in three days’ time, once more become a fair
and beautiful Princess; but if you desert me, I
must remain forever hideous.”</p>

<p>Although the sight of her filled him with repulsion,
the Prince was a man of honor, and would
not break his word. Calling the ladies who were
waiting in the carriage which he had brought to
convey his bride to the palace, he bade them array
her in the satin gown, and, pretending not to see
their astonishment and disgust, drove back with
her to his father, introducing her as his promised
wife.</p>

<p>The Sultan was naturally horrified at her appearance,
but when the Prince explained to him
how matters stood, he agreed that he must marry
her, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>While the father and son talked thus together,
the negress wandered over the palace, giving unnecessary
orders to the servants, and making herself
hateful to all. She even ventured into the
great kitchens, and commanded the chief cook to
prepare rich viands for her wedding ceremonies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
As she issued her orders in a loud, harsh voice, she
passed by the window, and noticed a slim white
pigeon sitting on the sill.</p>

<p>“Kill me that bird,” she cried, “and cook it for
my supper.”</p>

<p>Not daring to disobey her, the chief cook killed it
immediately, plunging a sharp knife into its snowy
breast. Three drops of blood fell from the window-sill
into the courtyard, and a tiny seedling sprang
from each of these. As if a fairy had waved her
wand, they grew into trees of fragrant blossom, and
in less time than it takes to tell, the blossoms turned
into golden lemons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince was seeking for his bride,
for since he had set himself so distasteful a task, he
wished to perform it well.</p>

<p>“She is in the kitchen, your Royal Highness,” he
was informed by one of his shocked courtiers, and
in going to meet her, the Prince passed under the
lemon-trees. The sight of their fruit brought him
a ray of hope, and gathering three of the finest that
he could find, he hastened with them to his own
room, where, having filled the golden cup with
water, he plunged the blade of the silver knife into
the rind of the first lemon.</p>

<p>As before, a beautiful girl appeared, and
stretched out her fair hands for the golden cup.</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” he cried. “You are very charming,
but you are not my Princess.”</p>

<p>He cut the rind of a second lemon, and as he
did so the second Princess took form before him.
He shook his head at her mute entreaty for a cup
of water, and she too disappeared. Then he cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
the rind of the third lemon, and lo, his own Princess
was once more in his arms!</p>

<p>Great was the joy and relief of the old Sultan
when he heard from the Prince that this beautiful
girl was his real bride, but he listened with a frown
of anger as she told them all that had happened
when her lover left her by the fountain. He ordered
the negress to be immediately brought before
him, and, regarding her very sternly, asked her
what she would think a fitting punishment for an
affront offered to the future wife of his dear son.</p>

<p>“Nothing less than death,” declared the negress,
“and death by burning. Let the offender be cast
into your Majesty’s oven, and the great door shut.”</p>

<p>“Madam, you have passed sentence on yourself,”
replied the Sultan dryly, and, shrieking with
terror, the negress was led away.</p>

<p>But the sweet Princess would not let her suffer.</p>

<p>“She is but a poor ignorant woman,” she said,
“and it must be sad to be so ugly. Set her free,
I entreat you, and let her go. This is the boon I
ask you for my wedding gift.”</p>

<p>The Sultan could not refuse his new daughter’s
first request, and the Prince regarded her fondly.</p>

<p>“I saw you were fair as morning, and white as
snow,” he murmured, “and now I know that you
are sweet as an angel.”</p>

<p>And though the years to come brought him
trouble and sorrow as well as joy, he was indeed
blest. Beloved of all, his Princess wielded a gentle
sway, and he never saw the fruit of a lemon without
sending a grateful thought to Spring for the magic
gifts by which he had fared so well.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WINTER-SPIRIT_AND_HIS">THE WINTER-SPIRIT AND HIS
VISITOR</h2>

<p class="author">By Cornelius Mathews</p>

<p class="dropcap">An old man was sitting alone in his lodge by the
side of a frozen stream. It was the close of
winter, and his fire was almost out. He appeared
very old and very desolate. His locks were white
with age, and he trembled in every joint. Day
after day passed in solitude, and he heard nothing
but the sounds of the tempest, sweeping before it
the new-fallen snow.</p>

<p>One day as his fire was just dying, a handsome
young man approached and entered his dwelling.
His cheeks were red with the blood of youth; his
eyes sparkled with life, and a smile played upon
his lips. He walked with a light and quick step.
His forehead was bound with a wreath of sweet
grass, in place of the warrior’s frontlet, and he
carried a bunch of flowers in his hand.</p>

<p>“Ah! my son,” said the old man, “I am happy to
see you. Come in. Come, tell me of your adventures,
and what strange lands you have been to see.
Let us pass the night together. I will tell you of
my prowess and exploits, and what I can perform.
You shall do the same, and we will amuse ourselves.”</p>

<p>He then drew from his sack a curiously-wrought
antique pipe, and having filled it with tobacco,
rendered mild by an admixture of certain dried
leaves, he handed it to his guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>When this ceremony was attended to, they began
to speak.</p>

<p>“I blow my breath,” said the old man, “and the
streams stand still. The water becomes stiff and
hard as clear stone.”</p>

<p>“I breathe,” said the young man, “and flowers
spring up all over the plains.”</p>

<p>“I shake my locks,” retorted the old man, “and
snow covers the land. The leaves fall from the
trees at my command, and my breath blows them
away. The birds rise from the water and fly to a
distant land. The animals hide themselves from
the glance of my eye, and the very ground where
I walk becomes as hard as flint.”</p>

<p>“I shake my ringlets,” rejoined the young man,
“and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the earth.
The plants lift up their heads out of the ground like
the eyes of children glistening with delight. My
voice recalls the birds. The warmth of my breath
unlocks the streams. Music fills the groves
wherever I walk, and all nature welcomes my
approach.”</p>

<p>At length the sun begun to rise. A gentle
warmth came over the place. The tongue of the
old man became silent. The robin and the bluebird
began to sing on the top of the lodge. The
stream began to murmur by the door, and the fragrance
of growing herbs and flowers came softly
on the vernal breeze.</p>

<p>Daylight fully revealed to the young man the
character of his entertainer. When he looked
upon him he had the visage of Peboan, the icy old
Winter-Spirit. Streams began to flow from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
eyes. As the sun increased he grew less and less
in stature, and presently he had melted completely
away. Nothing remained on the place of his
lodge-fire but the miskodeed, a small white flower
with a pink border, which the young visitor, Seegwun,
the Spirit of Spring, placed in the wreath
upon his brow, as his first trophy in the North.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
